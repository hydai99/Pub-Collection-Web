Here we present cytoself, a deep-learning approach for fully self-supervised protein localization profiling and clustering. Cytoself leverages a self-supervised training scheme that does not require preexisting knowledge, categories or annotations. Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches. Moreover, to better understand the inner workings of our model, we dissect the emergent features from which our clustering is derived, interpret them in the context of the fluorescence images, and analyze the performance contributions of each component of our approach.",35879608,10.1038/s41592-022-01541-z.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9349041/,,07/25/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hirofumi.kobayashi@czbiohub.org.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. manuel.leonetti@czbiohub.org.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. loic.royer@czbiohub.org.",,,2022 Aug;19(8):995-1003.,0,,

A systematic understanding of host factors influencing viral infection is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in murine models. These mucins also inhibit infection of diverse respiratory viruses. This functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors provides a physiologically relevant starting point for new host-directed therapeutics and highlights airway mucins as a host defense mechanism.",35879412,10.1038/s41588-022-01131-x.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9355872/,,07/25/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.5 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.6 Marsico Lung Institute and Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.8 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.9 Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.10 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.11 Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.12 Department of Chemistry and Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.13 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.14 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.15 Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.16 The Henry Wheeler Center for Emerging and Neglected Diseases, Berkeley, CA, USA.17 Department of Genetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.18 Department of Regenerative and Cancer Cell Biology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA.19 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.20 Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.21 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.22 Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.23 Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. eharris@berkeley.edu.24 Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. silvanak@stanford.edu.25 Arc Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA. silvanak@stanford.edu.26 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.27 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.28 Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.29 Arc Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Aug;54(8):1078-1089.,0,,

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",35817986,10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y,,07/11/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.6 Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.9 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.10 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.11 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.12 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.13 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.14 Diabetes Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.15 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.16 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.17 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.18 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Aug;54(8):1133-1144.,0,,
5,09/01/2022,Avishai Shemesh;Harry Pickering;Kole T Roybal;Lewis L Lanier,J Exp Med,Differential IL-12 signaling induces human natural killer cell activating receptor-mediated ligand-specific expansion,"IL-12 is an essential cytokine involved in the generation of memory or memory-like NK cells. Mouse cytomegalovirus infection triggers NK receptor-induced, ligand-specific IL-12-dependent NK cell expansion, yet specific IL-12 stimulation ex vivo leading to NK cell proliferation and expansion is not established. Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion. These findings demonstrate that activating NK receptor stimulation promotes differential IL-12 signaling, leading to human NK cell expansion, and suggest adopting strategies to provide IL-12 signaling in vivo for ligand-specific IL-2-primed NK cell-based therapies.",35758909,10.1084/jem.20212434.,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20212434,,06/27/2022,08/01/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.2 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA.3 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.4 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.6 Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.7 University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.",,,2022 Aug 1;219(8):e20212434.,0,,

We conducted a population size-weighted, one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of health insurance coverage, using a population-based sample of 2,035,401 participants ages 15-59 from nationally representative household surveys in fifty-six countries during the period 2006-18. One in five people (20.3 percent) across the fifty-six countries in our study had health insurance. Health insurance coverage exceeded 50 percent in only seven countries and 70 percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4 percent versus 28.6 percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege.

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease.",35896747,10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4,,07/27/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.5 Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.",,,2022 Aug;608(7921):161-167.,0,,

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

Although the number of e-cigarette users has been increasing, the potential health impacts and biological effects of e-cigarettes are still not fully understood. Previous research has focused on the biological effects of e-cigarettes on lung cancer cell lines and distal airway epithelial cells; however, there have been few published studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on primary lung alveolar epithelial cells. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effect of e-cigarette aerosol on primary human lung alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, both alone and in the presence of viral infection. The Melo-3 atomizer caused direct AT2 cell toxicity, whereas the more popular Juul pod's aerosol did not have a detectable cytotoxic effect on AT2 cells. Juul nicotine aerosol also did not increase short-term susceptibility to viral infection. However, 3 days of exposure upregulated genes central to the generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carcinogen metabolism and downregulated key innate immune system genes related to cytokine and chemokine signaling. These findings have implications for the potentially injurious impact of long-term use of popular low-power e-cigarette pods on the human alveolar epithelium. Gene expression data might be an important endpoint for evaluating the potential harmful effects of vaping devices that do not cause overt toxicity.

Sequencing such a provirus and the adjacent host junctions in individual cells may elucidate the mechanisms of the persistence of infected cells, but this is difficult owing to the 150-million-fold higher amount of background human DNA. Here we show that full-length proviruses connected to their contiguous HIV-host DNA junctions can be assembled via a high-throughput microfluidic assay where droplet-based whole-genome amplification of HIV DNA in its native context is followed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to tag droplets containing proviruses for sequencing. We assayed infected cells from people with HIV receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, resulting in the detection and sequencing of paired proviral genomes and integration sites, 90% of which were not recovered by commonly used nested-PCR methods. The sequencing of individual proviral genomes with their integration sites could improve the genetic analysis of persistent HIV-infected cell reservoirs.",35347274,10.1038/s41551-022-00864-8.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-022-00864-8,,03/28/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Virus Persistence and Dynamics Section, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.3 Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.4 Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.5 Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.6 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.7 Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. adam@abatelab.org.8 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. adam@abatelab.org.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. adam@abatelab.org.",,,2022 Aug;6(8):1004-1012.,0,,

Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.              Methods:                    Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.              Results:                    Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.              Interpretation:                    Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.

Here, we introduce Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP), which combines artificial-intelligence-driven image analysis of cellular phenotypes with automated single-cell or single-nucleus laser microdissection and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. DVP links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context. By individually excising nuclei from cell culture, we classified distinct cell states with proteomic profiles defined by known and uncharacterized proteins. In an archived primary melanoma tissue, DVP identified spatially resolved proteome changes as normal melanocytes transition to fully invasive melanoma, revealing pathways that change in a spatial manner as cancer progresses, such as mRNA splicing dysregulation in metastatic vertical growth that coincides with reduced interferon signaling and antigen presentation.

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation. Our findings reveal β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells implying a role of S1P1 signaling in remyelination.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.Methods The gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.Results Variation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.Conclusions The observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502150,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502150v1,2022.07.30.502150,08/02/2022,,2022-08-02,"Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine","Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine",,,0,,

It is unknown how dietary changes influence liver homeostasis. Here, we show that a switch from ad libitum feeding to intermittent fasting, IF, promotes rapid hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat.

However, limited tumor-sequencing data from H/L are available to guide treatment. To address this gap, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from 140 HL germline and 146 matched breast tumors and RNA-seq for the tumors. We generated somatic-mutation profiles, identified copy-number alterations (CNAs), and compared results to non-Hispanic White (White) women in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Similar to Whites, PIK3CA and TP53 were the most commonly mutated genes in breast tumors from H/L. We found 4 common COSMIC mutation signatures (1, 2, 3, 13) and signature 16 not previously reported in other breast-cancer datasets. We observed recurrent amplifications in breast-cancer drivers including MYC, FGFR1, CCND1, and ERBB2, and a recurrent amplification on 17q11.2 associated with high KIAA0100 gene expression, implicated in breast-cancer aggressiveness.

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers.

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Lishko",biorxiv,Mitochondrial uncouplers impair human sperm motility without altering ATP content,"Sperm motility is necessary for successful fertilization, but there remains controversy about whether human sperm motility is primarily powered by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.Significance Statement Development of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502752,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502752v2,2022.08.04.502752,08/08/2022,,2022-08-08,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Urology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University","Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Urology, University of California; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging",,,0,,

Thyroid hormone synthesis is controlled by thyrotropin (TSH), which acts at the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR)2. Autoantibodies that activate the TSHR pathologically increase thyroid hormones in Graves' disease3. How autoantibodies mimic TSH function remains unclear. We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of active and inactive TSHR. In inactive TSHR, the extracellular domain lies close to the membrane bilayer. TSH selects an upright orientation of the extracellular domain due to steric clashes between a conserved hormone glycan and the membrane bilayer. An activating autoantibody from a Graves' disease patient selects a similar upright orientation of the extracellular domain. Reorientation of the extracellular domain transduces a conformational change in the seven transmembrane domain via a conserved hinge domain, a tethered peptide agonist, and a phospholipid that binds within the seven transmembrane domain. Rotation of the TSHR extracellular domain relative to the membrane bilayer is sufficient for receptor activation, revealing a shared mechanism for other glycoprotein hormone receptors that may also extend to other G protein-coupled receptors with large extracellular domains.",35940205,10.1038/s41586-022-05159-1.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05159-1,,,08/08/2022,2022-08-08,"1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.5 Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.6 Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.8 Mass Spectrometry Core for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.9 Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.10 Trophogen, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.11 Clayton Foundation Laboratory for Peptide Biology Lab, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.12 Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene in Culex mosquitoes are associated with knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. RNAseq was used to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. The cDNA sequences were used to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F kdr mutation in the Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay was used successfully in six Culex spp. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. The L1014F kdr mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and was more prevalent in mosquitoes collected near farmland. The Culex RTkdr assay takes advantage of the RNA that vector control agencies routinely isolate to assess arbovirus prevalence in mosquitoes. We anticipate that public health and vector control agencies may employ the Culex RTkdr assay to define the geographic distribution of the L1014F kdr mutation in Culex species and improve the monitoring of insecticide resistance that will ultimately contribute to effective control of Culex mosquitoes.",35939507,10.1371/journal.pone.0252498.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9359573/,,2022,08/08/2022,2022-08-08,"1 Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.2 School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.4 University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.5 Sacramento-Yolo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, CA, United States of America.",,,2022 Aug 8;17(8):e0252498.,0,,

Defects in alternative splicing are associated with many heart diseases, yet relatively little is known about how cell type- or cell state-specific alternative splicing is achieved in the heart. Here, we show that GATA4 regulates cell type-specific splicing through direct interaction with RNA and the spliceosome in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors.              Methods:                    We leveraged a combination of unbiased approaches including affinity purification of GATA4 and mass spectrometry, enhanced cross-linking with immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, in vitro splicing assays, and unbiased transcriptomic analysis to uncover GATA4's novel function as a splicing regulator in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors.              Results:                    We found that GATA4 interacts with many members of the spliceosome complex in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors. Enhanced cross-linking with immunoprecipitation demonstrated that GATA4 also directly binds to a large number of mRNAs through defined RNA motifs in a sequence-specific manner. In vitro splicing assays indicated that GATA4 regulates alternative splicing through direct RNA binding, resulting in functionally distinct protein products. Correspondingly, knockdown of GATA4 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors resulted in differential alternative splicing of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization and calcium ion import, with functional consequences associated with the protein isoforms.              Conclusions:                    This study shows that in addition to its well described transcriptional function, GATA4 interacts with members of the spliceosome complex and regulates cell type-specific alternative splicing via sequence-specific interactions with RNA. Several genes that have splicing regulated by GATA4 have functional consequences and many are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting a novel role for GATA4 in achieving the necessary cardiac proteome in normal and stress-responsive conditions.

Current treatment strategies focus on mTOR inhibition with rapamycin and its derivatives. While effective at improving some aspects of TSC, chronic rapamycin inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and is associated with systemic side-effects. It is currently unknown which mTOR complex is most relevant for TSC-related brain phenotypes. Here we used genetic strategies to selectively reduce neuronal mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity in mouse models of TSC. We find that reduction of the mTORC1 component Raptor, but not the mTORC2 component Rictor, rebalanced mTOR signaling in Tsc1 knock-out neurons. Raptor reduction was sufficient to improve several TSC-related phenotypes including neuronal hypertrophy, macrocephaly, impaired myelination, network hyperactivity, and premature mortality.

Air pollution in many areas of South Asia is seasonal, with large spikes in particulate matter (PM) concentration occurring in the winter months. This study exploits this seasonal variation in PM concentration through a natural experiment.              Objective:                    This project aims to determine the causal effect of PM exposure during pregnancy on pregnancy and child health outcomes.              Methods:                    We will use an instrumental variable (IV) design whereby the estimated month of conception is our instrument for exposure to PM with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) during pregnancy. We will assess the plausibility of our assumption that timing of conception is exogenous with regard to our outcomes of interest and will adjust for date of monsoon onset to control for confounding variables related to harvest timing. Our outcomes are 1) birth weight, 2) pregnancy termination resulting in miscarriage, abortion, or still birth, 3) neonatal death, 4) infant death, and 5) child death. We will use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in relevant regions of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, along with monthly gridded data on PM2.5 concentration (0.1°×0.1° spatial resolution), precipitation data (0.5°×0.5° resolution), temperature data (0.5°×0.5°), and agricultural land use data (0.1°×0.1° resolution).              Results:                    Data access to relevant DHSs was granted on June 6, 2021 for India, Nepal, Bangladesh, August 24, 2021 for Pakistan, and June 19 2022 for the latest DHS from India.              Conclusions:                    If the assumptions for a causal interpretation of our instrumental variable analysis are met, this analysis will provide important causal evidence on the maternal and child health effects of PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy.

We develop a multi-model pipeline combining Rosetta protein modeling software and cryo-EM to allow interface energy calculations even at limited resolution and identify interface side chains that allow for high affinity interactions between our ACE2 receptor traps and Spike-RBD. Our structural analysis provides a mechanistic rationale for the high affinity (0.53 - 4.2nM) binding of our ACE2 receptor traps to Omicron-RBD confirmed with biolayer interferometry measurements.

Secreted factors regulate organ development and mediate homeostasis through serum trafficking and inter-organ communication. Enzyme-catalysed proximity labelling enables the identification of proteins within a specific cellular compartment. Here, we report a BirA*G3 mouse strain that enables CRE-dependent promiscuous biotinylation of proteins trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum. When broadly activated throughout the mouse, widespread labelling of proteins was observed within the secretory pathway. Streptavidin affinity purification and peptide mapping by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics revealed organ-specific secretory profiles and serum trafficking. As expected, secretory proteomes were highly enriched for signal peptide-containing proteins, highlighting both conventional and non-conventional secretory processes, and ectodomain shedding. Lower-abundance proteins with hormone-like properties were recovered and validated using orthogonal approaches. Hepatocyte-specific activation of BirA*G3 highlighted liver-specific biotinylated secretome profiles. The BirA*G3 mouse model demonstrates enhanced labelling efficiency and tissue specificity over viral transduction approaches and will facilitate a deeper understanding of secretory protein interplay in development, and in healthy and diseased adult states.

A lack of suitable model systems limits the mechanistic understanding of telomere shortening in the stem cells and thus hinders the development of treatment options for BM failure. Here, we endogenously introduced TIN2-DC mutations in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to dissect the disease mechanism and identify a gene-editing strategy that rescued the disease phenotypes. The hESCs with the T284R disease mutation exhibited the short telomere phenotype observed in DC patients. Yet, telomeres in mutant hESCs did not trigger DNA damage responses at telomeres or show exacerbated telomere shortening when differentiated into telomerase-negative cells. Disruption of the mutant TINF2 allele by introducing a frameshift mutation in exon 2 restored telomere length in stem cells and the replicative potential of differentiated cells. Similarly, we introduced TIN2-DC disease variants in human HSPCs to assess the changes in telomere length and proliferative capacity. Lastly, we showed that editing at exon 2 of TINF2 that restored telomere length in hESCs could be generated in TINF2-DC patient HSPCs. Our study demonstrates a simple genetic intervention that rescues the TIN2-DC disease phenotype in stem cells and provides a versatile platform to assess the efficacy of potential therapeutic approaches in vivo.",35421215,10.1182/blood.2021013750.,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2021013750,,,08/11/2022,2022-08-11,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.2 Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.3 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; and.5 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.",,,2022 Aug 11;140(6):608-618.,0,,

Attempts have been made in the past to computationally predict which bacterial species and enzymes are responsible for chemical transformations in the gut environment, but with low accuracy due to minimal chemical representation and sequence similarity search schemes. Here, we present an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER).

We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug transformations known to occur in the human gut. Bacterial species containing these enzymes are enriched within human donor stool samples that metabolize the query compound. After demonstrating its utility and accuracy, we chose to make SIMMER available as both a command-line and web tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical transformations within the human gut.

Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type.

Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary → peripheral endocrine gland → diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.

However, the estimated velocity only gives a snapshot of how the transcriptome instantaneously changes in individual cells, and it does not provide quantitative predictions and insights about the whole system. In this work, we develop RNA-ODE, a principled computational framework that extends RNA velocity to quantify systems level dynamics and improve single-cell data analysis. We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism. Given a snapshot of gene expression at one time, RNA-ODE is able to predict and extrapolate the expression trajectory of each cell by solving the dynamic equations. Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Theis, Nir Yosef",biorxiv,Deep generative modeling of transcriptional dynamics for RNA velocity analysis in single cells,"RNA velocity has been rapidly adopted to guide the interpretation of transcriptional dynamics in snapshot single-cell transcriptomics data. Current approaches for estimating and analyzing RNA velocity can empirically reveal complex dynamics but lack effective strategies for quantifying the uncertainty of the estimate and its overall applicability to the system of interest. Here, we present veloVI (velocity variational inference), a deep generative modeling framework for estimating RNA velocity. veloVI learns a gene-specific dynamical model of RNA metabolism and provides a transcriptome-wide quantification of velocity uncertainty. We show in a series of examples that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches for inferring RNA velocity with improvements in fit to the data, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells, and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that properties unique to veloVI, such as posterior velocity uncertainty, can be used to assess the appropriateness of analysis with velocity to the data at hand. Finally, we highlight veloVI as a flexible framework for modeling transcriptional dynamics by adapting the underlying dynamical model to use time-dependent transcription rates.",,10.1101/2022.08.12.503709,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.12.503709v1,2022.08.12.503709,08/15/2022,,2022-08-15,"Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California; Department of Mathematics, Technical University of Munich; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center Munich; TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan, Technical University of Munich","Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center Munich; Department of Mathematics, Technical University of Munich; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center Munich; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center Munich; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center Munich; Department of Mathematics, Technical University of Munich; TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan, Technical University of Munich; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California",,,0,,

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",35969644,10.1371/journal.ppat.1010543.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9410543/,,08/2022,08/15/2022,2022-08-15,"1 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.2 Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.3 Diamond Light Source, Didcot, United Kingdom.4 Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.5 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.6 Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.7 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.8 Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.9 Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.10 Department of Cell Biology & Physiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.11 Department of Microbiology & Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.",,,2022 Aug 15;18(8):e1010543.,0,,

THP is a precursor in the production of the drugs atracurium and cisatracurium, and papaverine is used as an antispasmodic during vascular surgery. In recent years, metabolic engineering advances have enabled the production of natural products through heterologous expression of pathway enzymes in yeast. Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products. Biosynthesis of THP and papaverine has not been achieved to date, in part because multiple pathway enzymes have not been elucidated. Here, we describe the development of an engineered yeast strain for de novo biosynthesis of THP. The production of THP is achieved through heterologous expression of two enzyme variants with activity on nonnative substrates. Through protein engineering, we developed a variant of N-methylcoclaurine hydroxylase with activity on coclaurine, enabling de novo norreticuline biosynthesis. Similarly, we developed a variant of scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase capable of O-methylating 1-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids at the 3' position, enabling de novo THP biosynthesis. Flux through the heterologous pathway was improved by knocking out yeast multidrug resistance transporters and optimization of media conditions. Overall, strain engineering increased the concentration of biosynthesized THP 600-fold to 121 µg/L. Finally, we demonstrate a strategy for papaverine semisynthesis using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. Through optimizing pH, temperature, reaction time, and oxidizing agent concentration, we demonstrated the ability to produce semisynthesized papaverine through oxidation of biosynthesized THP.

We applied this approach to study the human proteasome from HEK cells and rapidly determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of major proteasomal complexes, including a high-resolution structure of intact human PA28αβ-20S. Our structures reveal that PA28 with a subunit stoichiometry of 3α/4β engages tightly with the 20S proteasome. Addition of a hydrophilic peptide shows that polypeptides entering through PA28 are held in the antechamber of 20S prior to degradation in the proteolytic chamber.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS.

Despite this, we currently lack a predictive understanding of how leaf-associated bacterial communities are structured within and across hosts, including how leaf traits shape this variation and how community assembly processes may differ across distinct microbial habitats on a leaf. In this study, we characterize the composition of bacterial phyllosphere communities from the upper and lower leaf surfaces of 66 plants across 24 species grown at a common site using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing leaves that vary in pH and stomatal densities and analyzing the leaf surfaces separately, we were able to test the key factors shaping the phyllosphere across host plant species from diverse geographical origins. We found a surprisingly large shared/core microbiome across species, as well as a strong effect of plant species and native origin in shaping composition. Importantly, we found the lower leaf side, where pH values are generally lower and stomatal densities higher, to have lower taxonomic richness relative to the upper leaf side. While the upper leaf side community appears to be more strongly influenced by dispersal effects, the lower leaf appears to be more strongly influenced by plant host filtering effects, as supported by higher relative abundance of shared core taxa and higher signatures of endemism. This work highlights important differences in community assembly processes across the upper and lower leaf microbiomes and underscores the importance of considering differences among habitats within a host when explaining microbial community assembly and composition.",,10.1101/2022.08.16.504148,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504148v1,2022.08.16.504148,08/17/2022,,2022-08-17,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Bioscience Engineering, University of Antwerp; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Bioscience Engineering, University of Antwerp; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.Methods We collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.Results Among 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples.

While many studies have focused on tick-borne bacteria, far less is known about tick-associated viruses and their roles in public health or tick physiology. To address this, we investigated patterns of bacterial and viral communities across two field populations of western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 100 individual ticks, we quantified taxon prevalence, abundance, and co-occurrence with other members of the tick microbiome. Our analysis revealed 11 novel RNA viruses from Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Picornaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Reoviridae, Solemovidiae, Narnaviridae, and 2 highly divergent RNA viruses lacking sequence similarity to known viral families. The majority of these viruses were also detectable in lab-raised ticks at all developmental life stages, localize to tick salivary glands, and show evidence of circulation in mice fed on by ticks. These data suggest that viruses are stable, heritable, and transmissible members of the tick microbiota.

We present a compact, tunable, high-capacity Cas12a barcoding system called dual acting inverted site array (DAISY). We combined high-throughput screening and machine learning to predict and optimize the 60-bp DAISY barcode sequences. After optimization, top-performing barcodes had ∼10-fold increased capacity relative to the best random-screened designs and performed reliably across diverse cell types. DAISY barcode arrays generated ∼12 bits of entropy and ∼66,000 unique barcodes. Thus, DAISY barcodes-at a fraction of the size of Cas9 barcodes-achieved high-capacity barcoding. We coupled DAISY barcoding with single-cell RNA-seq to recover lineages and gene expression profiles from ∼47,000 human melanoma cells. A single DAISY barcode recovered up to ∼700 lineages from one parental cell. This analysis revealed heritable single-cell gene expression and potential epigenetic modulation of memory gene transcription. Overall, Cas12a DAISY barcoding is an efficient tool for investigating cell-state dynamics.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue composition within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude. These results suggest that our EIS smart bone plate can provide continuous and highly sensitive quantitative tissue measurements throughout the course of fracture healing to better guide personalized clinical care.

In the ocean, gravity plays a critical role in shaping the life history of phytoplankton with vast diversity of size and cell geometries all depending on light to survive while gravity is pulling them down. In order to survive, these organisms must evolve means to navigate a vertically stratified ocean. Here we present how cellular topology can enable sinking, rising, and levitation dynamics of seemingly non-motile cells in the open ocean. By studying the bio-luminescent dinoflagellate Pyrocystis noctiluca, we discover how rapid inflation dynamics regulates cell size and buoyancy in coordination to its cell cycle. Live-cell light-sheet imaging reveals a (n-genus) toroidal cytoplasm that enables this rapid inflation of overall cell volume over 5 fold in 15 minutes without dilution of cytoplasmic contents. Here we present combined field and lab measurements with system modeling to build a general framework for how non-motile plankton can escape the gravitational sedimentation trap, and how precise control of cell size becomes essential to survival.

This matrix is estimated from fluxes between communities, obtained from cell-phone tracking data recorded in the USA between March 2020 and February 2021. We apply this model to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by fitting just one global parameter representing the frequency of interaction between individuals. We find that the predicted infections agree reasonably well with the reported cases. We clearly see the effect of “shelter-in-place” policies introduced at the onset of the pandemic. Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel. We find that this policy is successful in decreasing the epidemic size and slowing down the spread, but less effective than the shelter-in-place policy. This policy can result in a pulled wave of infections. We express its velocity and characterize the shape of the traveling front as a function of the epidemiological parameters.

To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, while others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each individual mutant in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, while others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with the same resistance gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with different resistance genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution, and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others. We add to a growing body of work describing the key role of phages in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host communities. Beyond this specific trait, our study provides new insight into the genetic architecture of historical contingency, a crucial component of interpreting and predicting evolution.

How animals without neurons process information and respond to environmental cues promises a new window into studying precursors of neuronal control and origin of the nervous system as we know it today. Robust decision making in animals, such as in chemotaxis or thermotaxis, often requires internal symmetry breaking (such as A-P axis) provided naturally by a given body plan of an animal. Here we report the discovery of robust thermotaxis behavior in Trichoplax adhaerens, an early-divergent, enigmatic animal with no anterior-posterior symmetry breaking (apolar), and no known neurons or muscles. We present the first quantitative and robust behavioral response assay in placozoan, which present an apolar flat geometry. By exposing T. adhaerens to a thermal gradient under a long-term imaging setup, we observe robust thermotaxis that occurs over timescale of hours, independent of any circadian rhythms. We quantify that T. adhaerens can detect thermal gradients of at least 0.1 °C/cm. Positive thermotaxis is observed for a range of baseline temperatures from 17-22.5 °C with motility trajectories to be well-described by a Lévy distribution. Interestingly, the organism does not maintain a fixed orientation while performing thermotaxis. Utilizing natural diversity in size of adult organisms (100um to a few mm), we also demonstrate a critical animal size above which thermotaxis behavior is hindered. Several TRP family homologs have been previously reported to be conserved in metazoans, including in T. adhaerens. We discover naringenin, a known TRPM3 antagonist, inhibits thermotaxis in T. adhaerens. The discovery of robust thermotaxis in T. adhaerens provides a tractable handle to interrogate information processing in a brainless animal.

To resolve causal variants, meta-analysis studies typically apply summary statistics-based fine-mapping methods as they are applied to single-cohort studies. However, it is unclear whether heterogeneous characteristics of each cohort (e.g., ancestry, sample size, phenotyping, genotyping, or imputation) affect fine-mapping calibration and recall. Here, we first demonstrate that meta-analysis fine-mapping is substantially miscalibrated in simulations when different genotyping arrays or imputation panels are included. To mitigate these issues, we propose a summary statistics-based QC method, SLALOM, that identifies suspicious loci for meta-analysis fine-mapping by detecting outliers in association statistics based on ancestry-matched local LD structure. Having validated SLALOM performance in simulations and the GWAS Catalog, we applied it to 14 disease endpoints from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative and found that 67% of loci showed suspicious patterns that call into question fine-mapping accuracy. These predicted suspicious loci were significantly depleted for having likely causal variants, such as nonsynonymous variants, as a lead variant (2.7x; Fisher’s exact P = 7.3 × 10−4). Compared to fine-mapping results in individual biobanks, we found limited evidence of fine-mapping improvement in the GBMI meta-analyses.

While some recurrent profiles are restricted to groups of closely related cells, others, which we term pathway expression motifs, reappear in distantly related cell types spanning diverse tissues and organs. Motif usage was generally uncorrelated between pathways, remained stable in a given cell type during aging, but could change in sudden punctuated transitions during development.

We developa unified mathematical model that quantitatively describes the transcriptomescale response of myeloid and lymphoid cell types to individual drugs and drugcombinations through a single inferred regulatory network. The mathematicalmodel reveals how drug combinations generate novel, macrophage and T-cellstates by recruiting combinations of gene expression programs through bothadditive and non-additive drug interactions.

Our results suggest that transcriptome-scale mathematicalmodels could enable the design of therapeutic strategies for programming thehuman immune system using combinations of therapeutics.",,10.48550/arXiv.2208.10661,https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10661,arXiv:2208.10661v1,08/23/2022,,2022-08-23,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10661,,0,,

To date, underlying molecular mechanisms of PSC remain unclear and therapeutic options for PSC patients are limited. We performed cell-free messenger RNA (cf-mRNA) next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the circulating transcriptome of PSC and non-invasively investigate potentially bioactive signals that are associated with PSC.METHODS Serum cf-mRNA profiles were compared among 50 individuals with PSC, 20 healthy controls, and 235 individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Tissue and cell type-of-origin genes that are dysregulated in subjects with PSC were evaluated. Subsequently, diagnostic classifiers were built using PSC dysregulated cf-mRNA genes.RESULTS Differential expression analysis of the cf-mRNA transcriptomes of PSC and healthy controls resulted in identification of 1407 dysregulated genes. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes between PSC and the liver diseases (NAFL and Non-Alcohol Steatohepatitis (NASH)) or healthy controls shared common genes known to be involved in liver pathophysiology. In particular, genes from liver- and specific cell type-origin, including hepatocyte, hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells, were highly abundant in cf-mRNA of subjects with PSC. Gene cluster analysis revealed that liver-specific genes dysregulated in PSC form a distinct cluster which corresponded to a subset of the PSC subject population. Finally, we developed a cf-mRNA classifier using liver-specific genes which discriminated PSC from healthy control subjects using gene transcripts of liver origin.CONCLUSIONS Blood-based whole transcriptome cf-mRNA profiling revealed high abundance of liver-specific genes in PSC subject sera which may be used to diagnose PSC patients. We identified several unique cf-mRNA profiles of subjects with PSC. These findings may also have utility for non-invasive molecular stratification of subjects with PSC for pharmacotherapy safety and response studies.Download figureOpen in new tab",,10.1101/2022.08.22.22278964,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/08/23/2022.08.22.22278964,2022.08.22.22278964,08/23/2022,,2022-08-23,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering and Department of Applied Physics; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Indiana University School of Medicine; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Stanford University","Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Indiana University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Indiana University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Indiana University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Indiana University School of Medicine; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Department of Bioengineering and Department of Applied Physics; Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.; Molecular Stethoscope Inc.",,,0,,

Objectives:                    This cross-sectional study aimed to determine how hypertension prevalence in LMICs varies by individuals' education and household wealth, and how these socioeconomic gradients in hypertension prevalence are associated with a country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.              Methods:                    We pooled nationally representative household survey data from 76 LMICs. We disaggregated hypertension prevalence by education and household wealth quintile, and used regression analyses to adjust for age and sex.              Results:                    We included 1,211,386 participants in the analysis. Pooling across all countries, hypertension prevalence tended to be similar between education groups and household wealth quintiles. The only world region with a clear positive association of hypertension with education or household wealth quintile was Southeast Asia. Countries with a lower GDP per capita had, on average, a more positive association of hypertension with education and household wealth quintile than countries with a higher GDP per capita, especially in rural areas and among men.              Conclusions:                    Differences in hypertension prevalence between socioeconomic groups were generally small, with even the least educated and least wealthy groups having a substantial hypertension prevalence. Our cross-sectional interaction analyses of GDP per capita with the socioeconomic gradients of hypertension suggest that hypertension may increasingly affect adults in the lowest socioeconomic groups as LMICs develop economically.

Here, we describe the development of human monoclonal antibodies that bind the ACE2 receptor rather than the viral spike protein. These antibodies block infection by all ACE2 binding sarbecoviruses, including emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that the antibodies target an ACE2 epitope that engages SARS-CoV-2 spike. Importantly, the antibodies do not inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity, nor do they induce ACE depletion from cell surfaces. The antibodies exhibit favorable pharmacology and protect human ACE2 knock-in mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Studies of hepatoblastoma that focus exclusively on tumor cells demonstrate sparse somatic mutations and a common cell of origin, the hepatoblast, across patients. In contrast to the homogeneity these studies would suggest, hepatoblastoma tumors have a high degree of heterogeneity that can portend poor prognosis. In this study, we use single-cell transcriptomic techniques to analyze resected human pediatric hepatoblastoma specimens, and identify five hepatoblastoma tumor signatures that may account for the tumor heterogeneity observed in this disease. Notably, patient-derived hepatoblastoma spheroid cultures predict differential responses to treatment based on the transcriptomic signature of each tumor, suggesting a path forward for precision oncology for these tumors.

Pollard",biorxiv,Maast: genotyping thousands of microbial strains efficiently,"Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of intraspecific genomes is a prerequisite to performing population genetic analysis and microbial epidemiology. However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maast’s utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maast is a fast, reliable SNP genotyping tool that empowers population genetic meta-analysis of microbes at an unrivaled scale.Availability source code of Maast is available at https://github.com/zjshi/Maast.Contact kpollard{at}gladstone.ucsf.edu",,10.1101/2022.07.06.499075,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.499075v2,2022.07.06.499075,08/25/2022,,2022-08-25,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Energy, Joint Genome Institute; Gladstone Institutes, Data Science and Biotechnology; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division; University of California San Francisco, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics","Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institutes, Data Science and Biotechnology; Department of Energy, Joint Genome Institute; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institutes, Data Science and Biotechnology; University of California San Francisco, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics",,,0,,

In response to infection by its viral host ICP1, PLE excises, replicates and hijacks ICP1 structural components for transduction. Through an unknown mechanism, PLE prevents ICP1 from transitioning to rolling circle replication (RCR), a prerequisite for efficient packaging of the viral genome. Here, we characterize a PLE-encoded nuclease, NixI, that blocks phage development likely by nicking ICP1's genome as it transitions to RCR. NixI-dependent cleavage sites appear in ICP1's genome during infection of PLE(+) V. cholerae. Purified NixI demonstrates in vitro nuclease activity specifically for sites in ICP1's genome and we identify a motif that is necessary for NixI-mediated cleavage. Importantly, NixI is sufficient to limit ICP1 genome replication and eliminate progeny production, representing the most inhibitory PLE-encoded mechanism revealed to date. We identify distant NixI homologs in an expanded family of putative phage parasites in vibrios that lack nucleotide homology to PLEs but nonetheless share genomic synteny with PLEs. More generally, our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism deployed by phage parasites to limit packaging of their viral hosts' genome and highlight the prominent role of nuclease effectors as weapons in the arms race between antagonizing genomes.",35066583,10.1093/nar/gkac002.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9410903/,,,08/26/2022,2022-08-26,"1 Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, 271 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.",,,2022 Aug 26;50(15):8401-8417.,0,,

Effector domains within these proteins can activate or repress transcription. However, for many of these regulators we do not know what type of transcriptional effector domains they contain, their location in the protein, their activation and repression strengths, and the amino acids that are necessary for their functions. Here, we systematically measure the transcriptional effector activity of >100,000 protein fragments (each 80 amino acids long) tiling across most chromatin regulators and transcription factors in human cells (2,047 proteins). By testing the effect they have when recruited at reporter genes, we annotate 307 new activation domains and 592 new repression domains, a ∼5-fold increase over the number of previously annotated effectors3,4. Complementary rational mutagenesis and deletion scans across all the effector domains reveal aromatic and/or leucine residues interspersed with acidic, proline, serine, and/or glutamine residues are necessary for activation domain activity. Additionally, the majority of repression domain sequences contain either sites for SUMOylation, short interaction motifs for recruiting co-repressors, or are structured binding domains for recruiting other repressive proteins. Surprisingly, we discover bifunctional domains that can both activate and repress and can dynamically split a cell population into high- and low-expression subpopulations. Our systematic annotation and characterization of transcriptional effector domains provides a rich resource for understanding the function of human transcription factors and chromatin regulators, engineering compact tools for controlling gene expression, and refining predictive computational models of effector domain function.",,10.1101/2022.08.26.505496,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.26.505496v1,2022.08.26.505496,08/26/2022,,2022-08-26,"Biophysics Program, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University","Biophysics Program, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Biophysics Program, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University",,,0,,

We developed TACIT (Tissue-Aware Conservation Inference Toolkit) to associate open chromatin regions (OCRs) with phenotypes using predictions in hundreds of mammalian genomes from machine learning models trained to learn tissue-specific regulatory codes. Applying TACIT for motor cortex and parvalbumin-positive interneurons to neurological phenotypes revealed dozens of new OCR-phenotype associations. Many associated OCRs were near relevant genes, including brain size-associated OCRs near genes mutated in microcephaly or macrocephaly. Our work creates a forward genomics foundation for identifying candidate enhancers associated with phenotype evolution.One Sentence Summary A new machine learning-based approach associates enhancers with the evolution of brain size and behavior across mammals.",,10.1101/2022.08.26.505436,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.26.505436v1,2022.08.26.505436,08/26/2022,,2022-08-26,"Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; College of Law, University of Iowa; Department of Biological Sciences, Lehigh University; Departments of Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine","Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Department of Biological Sciences, Lehigh University; College of Law, University of Iowa; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Department of Biological Sciences, Lehigh University; Departments of Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Biology, Carnegie Mellon University; Departments of Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University",,,0,,

Recently, deep-learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in classifying variants as pathogenic or benign. However, these models are currently unable to provide predictions over all missense variants, either because of dependency on close protein homologs or due to software limitations. Here we leveraged ESM1b, a 650M-parameter protein language model, to predict the functional impact of human coding variation at scale. To overcome existing technical limitations, we developed a modified ESM1b workflow and functionalized, for the first time, all proteins in the human genome, resulting in predictions for all ∼450M possible missense variant effects. ESM1b was able to distinguish between pathogenic and benign variants across ∼150K variants annotated in ClinVar and HGMD, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. ESM1b also exceeded the state of the art at predicting the experimental results of deep mutational scans. We further annotated ∼2M variants across ∼9K alternatively-spliced genes as damaging in certain protein isoforms while neutral in others, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms when functionalizing variant effects.

Normally asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune dysfunction, and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth are not defined. Here, we show that control of mite HF colonization in mice required group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), interleukin-13 (IL-13), and its receptor, IL-4Ra-IL-13Ra1. HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice. Our studies uncover a key role for skin ILC2s and IL-13, which comprise an immune checkpoint that sustains cutaneous integrity and restricts pathologic infestation by colonizing HF mites.

Previous studies have shown that the human gut is a hot spot for gene transfer between species, but the more subtle exchange of variation within species – collectively known as recombination – remains poorly characterized in this ecosystem. Here, we show that the genetic structure of the human gut microbiome provides unique opportunities to measure individual recombination events directly, enabling quantitative comparisons of recombination across a diverse range of species that inhabit a common environment. By analyzing a large collection of recent recombination events in the core genomes of 29 gut commensals, we uncovered systematic heterogeneities in the rates and lengths of transferred segments, which are difficult to explain by existing models of ecological isolation or reduced efficiencies of recombination. We also find that natural selection plays a role in facilitating the spread of genetic variants onto different strain backgrounds, both within individual hosts and across the broader global population. These results shed light on the dynamics of in situ recombination, which place important constraints on the adaptability of gut microbial communities.",,10.1101/2022.08.24.505183,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.24.505183v1,2022.08.24.505183,08/26/2022,,2022-08-26,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University","Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University; Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

Here, we identify a new protist species, Tritrichomonas casperi, and show that metabolic differences between closely related commensal protists modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the murine microbiota. Genomic and metabolomic analysis of commensal tritrichomonads reveal species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, leading to differential induction of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells in the small intestine. Using defined diets and in vitro growth assays, we show that different tritrichomonad species preferentially rely on dietary polysaccharides or mucus glycans, which leads to trans-kingdom competition with specific bacteria in the microbiota.

To better understand the role of long-range interactions between distal regulatory elements during the early transformation from healthy colon to colorectal cancer, here we performed high resolution chromatin conformation capture for 33 samples including non-neoplastic mucosa, adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinomas, mostly from Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients. We identified hundreds of thousands of chromatin micro-structures, such as architectural stripes and loops, which originated from active cis-regulatory elements. Surprisingly, these structures progressively decayed throughout cancer progression, particularly at promoters. Meta-analyses revealed that this decay was independent of alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. Interestingly, the degree of interaction loss was poorly correlated with gene expression changes. Instead, genes whose expression were disproportionately lower and higher than their relative promoter interaction in mucosa shifted their expression in polyps and adenocarcinomas to yield a more direct relationship between strength of interaction and gene expression.

Invariably, at least one member of the perilipin family of proteins (PLIN1-5) associates with LDs in all cell types. Despite key roles of PLIN2 in governing hepatic lipid metabolism, the mechanisms that regulate PLIN2 levels remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a set of genome-edited PLIN2 reporter cell lines that facilitate the analysis of genes that regulate PLIN2 and LD abundance. Leveraging these reporter cells in a series of CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens, we generate a comprehensive inventory of genes that influence PLIN2 levels under different metabolic conditions. Moreover, we uncouple their effects on PLIN2 expression and post-translational stability. Identified genetic modifiers include canonical genes that control LD metabolism (e.g., ACSL3, DGAT2, PNPLA2, ABHD5) as well as genes with less characterized roles in PLIN2 and LD regulation such as ubiquitination machinery (e.g., MARCH6, UBE2J2), transcription regulators (e.g., HNF4A, HDAC3), mitochondrial pathways (e.g., electron transport chain and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis), and others.

These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the nearly complete 16,740-nucleotide genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses-HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)-but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the virus's potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover. IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus that likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.

Gametocyte production varies between infections and over the course of infections. Infection duration is influenced by host and parasite characteristics, and is highly important for gametocyte production but poorly quantified. Between 2017-2019 an all-age cohort from Tororo, eastern Uganda was followed by continuous passive and routine assessments. Among 104 longitudinally monitored incident infections coming from 98 individuals, we observed that nearly all infections lasting 3 or more months initiated gametocyte production prior to clearance. However, the majority of infections were of shorter duration (<28 days) and were cleared before gametocytes were detectable. Infections in individuals with sickle-cell trait were more likely to produce gametocytes and produced gametocytes at higher densities. Our findings suggest that a large proportion of infections may be too short in duration and of too low density to contribute to onward transmission.",,10.1101/2022.08.29.22279332,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/08/30/2022.08.29.22279332,2022.08.29.22279332,08/30/2022,,2022-08-30,"Department for Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the  Netherlands; Department for Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK; Department of Infection Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK; Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda; Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI; Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration, Kampala, Uganda; Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; Radboud university medical center; UCSF","Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department for Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the  Netherlands; Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration, Kampala, Uganda; Department of Infection Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK; UCSF; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI; Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; Department of Medicine, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda; Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration, Kampala, Uganda; Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, USA; Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK; Department for Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Radboud university medical center",,,0,,

It is thought to be a key contributing factor to childhood malnutrition, growth stunting, and diminished oral vaccine responses. Although EE has been shown to be the by-product of a recurrent enteric infection, its full pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, we mapped the cellular and molecular correlates of EE by performing high-throughput, single-cell RNA-sequencing on 33 small intestinal biopsies from 11 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia (eight HIV-negative and three HIV-positive), six adults without EE in Boston, United States, and two adults in Durban, South Africa, which we complemented with published data from three additional individuals from the same clinical site. We analyzed previously defined bulk-transcriptomic signatures of reduced villus height and decreased microbial translocation in EE and showed that these signatures may be driven by an increased abundance of surface mucosal cells-a gastric-like subset previously implicated in epithelial repair in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, we determined cell subsets whose fractional abundances associate with EE severity, small intestinal region, and HIV infection. Furthermore, by comparing duodenal EE samples with those from three control cohorts, we identified dysregulated WNT and MAPK signaling in the EE epithelium and increased proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in a T cell subset highly expressing a transcriptional signature of tissue-resident memory cells in the EE cohort.

The glucagon receptor (GCGR), a Family B GPCR responsible for maintenance of proper blood sugar levels, interacts with RAMP2, though the purpose and consequence of this interaction is poorly understood. Using a series of biochemical and cell-based assays, we show that RAMP2 interacts with and broadly inhibits GCGR-induced downstream signaling. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) demonstrates that RAMP2 enhances local flexibility in select locations in and near the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) as well as at a key region in  the  6th transmembrane  helix,  while  single-molecule  fluorescence  resonance  energy  transfer (smFRET)  experiments  show  that this  RAMP2-induced  ECD  disorder results  in inhibition  of active  and  intermediate  states  of  the  intracellular  face  of  the  receptor.Using  cryo-electron microscopy(cryoEM), we determined the structure of the GCGR-Gs complex at 2.9 Å resolution in the presence of RAMP2. RAMP2 apparently does not interact with GCGR in an ordered manner, yet theECD of GCGR is indeed largely disordered in the presence of RAMP2.This disorder is accompanied by rearrangements of several key areas of the receptor, resulting in the formation of a  likely  unproductive  complex.  Together,  our  studies  suggest  that  RAMP2 acts  as  a  negative allosteric modulator of GCGR by enhancing conformational sampling of the ECD.",,10.1101/2022.08.30.505955,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505955v1,2022.08.30.505955,08/31/2022,,2022-08-31,"Philipps-University Marburg; Stanford University; University of California, Berkeley; Zealand Pharma","Stanford University; University of California, Berkeley; Zealand Pharma; Philipps-University Marburg",,,0,,

Targeted gene editing has the potential to overcome these limitations and enhance T cell therapeutic function3-10. Here we performed multiple genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens under different immunosuppressive conditions to identify genes that can be targeted to prevent T cell dysfunction. These screens converged on RASA2, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) that we identify as a signalling checkpoint in human T cells, which is downregulated upon acute T cell receptor stimulation and can increase gradually with chronic antigen exposure. RASA2 ablation enhanced MAPK signalling and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell cytolytic activity in response to target antigen. Repeated tumour antigen stimulations in vitro revealed that RASA2-deficient T cells show increased activation, cytokine production and metabolic activity compared with control cells, and show a marked advantage in persistent cancer cell killing. RASA2-knockout CAR T cells had a competitive fitness advantage over control cells in the bone marrow in a mouse model of leukaemia. Ablation of RASA2 in multiple preclinical models of T cell receptor and CAR T cell therapies prolonged survival in mice xenografted with either liquid or solid tumours.
