However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, this work provides a simplified purification scheme for ferritin-based vaccines.",,,,,,2022-08-13,2022/08/12,2022/8/13,Payton Weidenbacher; Sriharshita Musunuri; Abigail E Powell; Shaogeng Tang; Jonathan Do; Mrinmoy Sanyal; Peter S Kim,,"Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.","Payton Weidenbacher: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Sriharshita Musunuri: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Abigail E Powell: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Shaogeng Tang: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Jonathan Do: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Mrinmoy Sanyal: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Peter S Kim: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.",,,,,,0

We sought new inhibitors of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) activity of Nsp14 with three large library docking strategies. First, up to 1.1 billion make-on-demand (""tangible"") lead-like molecules were docked against the enzymes SAM site, seeking reversible inhibitors. On de novo synthesis and testing, three inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 43 M, each with novel chemotypes. Structure-guided optimization and in vitro characterization supported their non-covalent mechanism. In a second strategy, docking a library of 16 million tangible fragments revealed nine new inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 341 M and ligand efficiencies from 0.29 to 0.42. In a third strategy, a newly created library of 25 million tangible, virtual electrophiles were docked to covalently modify Cys387 in the SAM binding site. Seven inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 3.2 to 39 M, the most potent being a reversible aldehyde. Initial optimization of a second series yielded a 7 M acrylamide inhibitor. Three inhibitors characteristic of the new series were tested for selectivity against 30 human protein and RNA MTases, with one showing partial selectivity and one showing high selectivity. Overall, 32 inhibitors encompassing eleven chemotypes had IC50 values <50 M and 5 inhibitors in four chemotypes had IC50 values <10 M. These molecules are among the first non-SAM-like inhibitors of Nsp14, providing multiple starting points for optimizing towards antiviral activity.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.12.523677,1,new results,2023-01-13,01/13/2023,,Isha Singh; Fengling Li; Elissa Fink; Irene Chau; Alice Li; Annía Rodriguez-Hernández; Isabella Glenn; Francisco J.

Here, we use thousands of microbial communities cultured in vitro from human feces to uncover simple assembly rules and develop a predictive model of community composition upon addition of single nutrients from central carbon metabolism to a complex medium. Community membership was largely determined by the donor feces, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient, due to the ability of fast-growing organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities. Our study reveals that community assembly follows simple rules of nutrient utilization dynamics and provides a predictive framework for manipulating gut commensal communities through nutritional perturbations.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.13.523996,1,new results,2023-01-14,01/14/2023,,Andrés Aranda-Díaz; Lisa Willis; Taylor H.

Using the antibody sequences of B cells, we tracked clones during in vitro differentiation. Clonal analysis revealed a subset of IgM+ B cells which were more proliferative than other B-cell types. Whereas the population of B cells adopted diverse states during differentiation, clones had a restricted set of fates available to them; there were two times more single-fate clones than expected given population-level cell-type diversity. This implicated a molecular memory of initial cell states that was propagated through differentiation. We then identified the genes which had strongest coherence within clones. These genes significantly overlapped known B-cell fate determination programs, suggesting the genes which determine cell identity are most robustly controlled on a clonal level. Persistent clonal identities were also observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, indicating that these transcriptional programs maintain long-term cell identities in vivo.

The discovery of conserved genes in viruses infecting geographically and phylogenetically diverse hosts has provided important evolutionary context for human and animal pathogens. However, the resulting viral genomes are often incomplete, and analyses largely characterize the distribution of viruses over their dynamics. Here, we show how the accumulated data of metagenomic studies can be integrated to reveal geographic and evolutionary dynamics in a case study of Orthomyxoviridae, the family of RNA viruses containing influenza virus. First, we use sequences of the orthomyxovirid W[u]han mosquito virus 6 to track the global migrations of its host. We then look at overall orthomyxovirus genome evolution, finding significant gene gain and loss across members of the family, especially in the surface proteins responsible for cell and host tropism. We find that the surface protein of W[u]han mosquito virus 6 exhibits accelerated non-synonymous evolution suggestive of antigenic evolution, and an entire quaranjavirid group bearing highly diverged surface proteins. Finally we quantify the progress of orthomyxovirus discovery and forecast that many highly diverged Orthomyxoviridae members remain to be found. We argue that continued metagenomic studies will be fruitful for understanding the dynamics, evolution, ecology of viruses and their hosts, regardless of whether novel viruses are actually identified or not, as long as study designs allowing for the resolution of complete viral genomes are employed.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.31.505987,3,new results,2023-01-16,01/16/2023,,Gytis Dudas; Joshua Batson,"Dudas, G.; Batson, J.",Vilnius University;; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub,"Gytis Dudas, Vilnius University;], [Joshua Batson, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",NA,,,,,0

We analyzed data from 93 ARDS patients with sepsis enrolled in a multi-center prospective cohort of critically ill patients, comparing 970 metabolites between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. 188 metabolites were differentially abundant between the two LCA-derived phenotypes.
