Despite several decades of effort, oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer remains difficult to treat, and our understanding of the regulators of RAS signalling is incomplete. Here to uncover the impact of diverse KRAS-interacting proteins on lung cancer growth, we combined multiplexed somatic CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in genetically engineered mouse models with tumour barcoding and high-throughput barcode sequencing. Through a series of CRISPR/Cas9 screens in autochthonous lung cancer models, we show that HRAS and NRAS are suppressors of KRAS",,,,,,2023-01-13,2023/01/12,2023/1/13,Rui Tang; Emily G Shuldiner; Marcus Kelly; Christopher W Murray; Jess D Hebert; Laura Andrejka; Min K Tsai; Nicholas W Hughes; Mitchell I Parker; Hongchen Cai; Yao-Cheng Li; Geoffrey M Wahl; Roland L Dunbrack; Peter K Jackson; Dmitri A Petrov; Monte M Winslow,,"Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Baxter Laboratories, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; The Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. mwinslow@stanford.edu.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. mwinslow@stanford.edu.; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. mwinslow@stanford.edu.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Gene Expression Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Molecular and Cell Biology and Genetics Program, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.","Rui Tang: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Emily G Shuldiner: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Marcus Kelly: Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Baxter Laboratories, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Christopher W Murray: Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Jess D Hebert: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Laura Andrejka: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Min K Tsai: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Nicholas W Hughes: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Mitchell I Parker: Molecular Therapeutics Program, Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Molecular and Cell Biology and Genetics Program, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.Hongchen Cai: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Yao-Cheng Li: Gene Expression Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.Geoffrey M Wahl: Gene Expression Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.Roland L Dunbrack: Molecular Therapeutics Program, Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.Peter K Jackson: Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Baxter Laboratories, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Dmitri A Petrov: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; The Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Monte M Winslow: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. mwinslow@stanford.edu.; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. mwinslow@stanford.edu.; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. mwinslow@stanford.edu.",,,,,,0

The set of possible intramolecular interactions of RNA nucleotides defines the range of alternative structural conformations of a specific RNA that can coexist, and these structures enable functional catalytic properties of RNAs and/or their productive intermolecular interactions with other RNAs or proteins. However, the immense combinatorial space of potential RNA sequences has precluded predictive mapping between RNA sequence and molecular structure and function. Recent advances in high-throughput approaches in vitro have enabled quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions, across hundreds of thousands of sequence variations. In this Review, we explore these techniques, how they can be used to understand RNA function and how they might form the foundations of an accurate model to predict the structure and function of an RNA directly from its nucleotide sequence. The experimental techniques and modelling frameworks discussed here are also highly relevant for the sampling of sequence-structure-function space of DNAs and proteins.",,,,,,2023-01-13,2023/01/12,2023/1/13,Emil Marklund; Yuxi Ke; William J Greenleaf,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. wjg@stanford.edu.","Emil Marklund: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Yuxi Ke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.William J Greenleaf: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. wjg@stanford.edu.",,,,,,0

However, most efforts to promote proactive BRM have focused on training life scientists in technical skills and have largely ignored the extent to which life scientists wish to use them (ie, their motivation). In this article, we argue that efforts to promote proactive BRM would benefit from a greater focus on life scientists' motivation. We review relevant literature on life scientists' motivation to practice BRM, offer examples of successful interventions from adjacent fields, and outline ideas for possible interventions to promote proactive BRM, along with strategies for iterative development, testing, and scaling.",Bioethics; Biorisk management; Biosafety; Biosecurity; Dual-use science; Psychological impacts,,,,,2023-01-13,2023/01/12,2023/1/13,Daniel Greene; Megan J Palmer; David A Relman,,"Daniel Greene, PhD, is a Senior Analyst, Biosafety, Biosecurity & Emerging Technologies, Gryphon Scientific, Takoma Park, MD.
