Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,2022-06-17,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering.

We find that while mammals resemble one another in total TE content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly LINEs, drive increases in genome size while DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to accumulate only a few types of TE at any given time, with one TE type dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental mammals.

In the absence of functional SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, proinsulin is retained in the ER as high molecular weight conformers, which are subsequently cleared via ER-phagy. A combined loss of both SEL1L and autophagy in β cells leads to diabetes in mice shortly after weaning, with premature death by approximately 11 weeks of age, associated with marked ER retention of proinsulin and β cell loss. Using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy powered by deep-learning automated image segmentation and 3D reconstruction, our data demonstrate a profound organellar restructuring with a massive expansion of ER volume and network in β cells lacking both SEL1L and autophagy. These data reveal at an unprecedented detail the intimate crosstalk among the 3 ER quality-control mechanisms in the dynamic regulation of organellar architecture and β cell function.",Autophagy; Cell Biology; Diabetes; Metabolism; Protein misfolding,,,,,2023-01-03,2023/01/03,2022/11/9,Neha Shrestha; Mauricio Torres; Jason Zhang; You Lu; Leena Haataja; Rachel B Reinert; Jeffrey Knupp; Yu-Jie Chen; Gunes Parlakgul; Ana Paula Arruda; Billy Tsai; Peter Arvan; Ling Qi,,"Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, School of Literature, Science, and the Arts, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.","Neha Shrestha: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Mauricio Torres: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Jason Zhang: Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, School of Literature, Science, and the Arts, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.You Lu: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Leena Haataja: Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Rachel B Reinert: Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Jeffrey Knupp: Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Yu-Jie Chen: Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Gunes Parlakgul: Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.Ana Paula Arruda: Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.Billy Tsai: Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Peter Arvan: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Ling Qi: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.",,,,,,0

The participants were randomly assigned with 1:1 to receive a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 or BBIBP-CorV. The primary outcomes were immunogenicity and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant, and the exploratory outcome was cross-immunogenicity against other circulating strains. Between May 25 and 30, 2022, 516 adults received booster vaccination with 260 in NVSI-06-09 group and 256 in BBIBP-CorV group. Interim results showed a similar safety profile between two booster groups, with low incidence of adverse reactions of grade 1 or 2. For immunogenicity, by day 14 post-booster, the fold rises in neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) from baseline elicited by NVSI-06-09 were remarkably higher than those by BBIBP-CorV against the prototype strain (19.67 vs 4.47-fold), Omicron BA.1.1 (42.35 vs 3.78-fold), BA.2 (25.09 vs 2.91-fold), BA.4 (22.42 vs 2.69-fold), and BA.5 variants (27.06 vs 4.73-fold). Similarly, the neutralizing GMTs boosted by NVSI-06-09 against Beta and Delta variants were also 6.60-fold and 7.17-fold higher than those by BBIBP-CorV. Our findings indicated that a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 was well-tolerated and elicited broad-spectrum neutralizing responses against divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron and its sub-lineages.",,,,,,2023-01-04,2023/01/03,2023/1/4,Nawal Al Kaabi;
