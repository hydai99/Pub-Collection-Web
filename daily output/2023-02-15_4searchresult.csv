Phosphopeptides presented in complex with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) have been reported to provide a stability advantage over their unmodified counterparts when presented by the common HLA allele A*02:01. This stability in turn is thought to translate to enhanced immunogenicity. Whether tumor-associated phosphopeptides presented by other common alleles exhibit immunogenicity and structural characteristics similar to those presented by A*02:01 is unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine the identity, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides presented by the common alleles HLA-A*03:01, -A*11:01, -C*07:01, and -C*07:02.

MethodsWe isolated peptide-MHC complexes by immunoprecipitation of 10 healthy and neoplastic tissue samples using mass spectrometry, and then combined the resulting data with public immunopeptidomics datasets to assemble a curated set of phosphopeptides presented by 20 distinct healthy and neoplastic tissue types. We determined the biochemical features of selected phosphopeptides by in vitro binding assays and in silico docking, and their immunogenicity by analyzing healthy donor T cells for phosphopeptide-specific multimer binding and cytokine production.

ResultsWe demonstrated that HLA-A*03:01 and -A*11:01 present shared phosphopeptides on multiple tumor types, particularly lymphomas and leukemias; a subset of these peptides were not found on healthy tissues. These phosphopeptides generally exhibited similar binding to A*11:01 and similar or worse binding to A*03:01 than their unmodified counterparts. Additionally, we found that HLA-C*07:01 phosphopeptides were generally presented in the absence of their unmodified counterparts, and were dependent on B-pocket interactions that were absent in C*07:02, but such interactions were still permissive to unmodified peptide binding. We found that HLA-A*02:01 and -A*11:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cells could be readily detected in an autologous setting, even when the wildtype peptide was co-presented. In contrast, HLA-A*03:01 or -C*07:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cell responses were not elicited in autologous donors, but could be elicited in allogeneic donors.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that phosphopeptides across multiple alleles represent shared tumor-specific antigens that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapy, but the immunogenicity of such phosphopeptides is not a general feature, which may be explained by a lack of increase in energetic favorability associated with phosphopeptide binding to A*03:01. Thus, to address an expanded patient population, phosphopeptide-targeted immunotherapies should be wary of allele-specific differences.

O_LIWhat is already known on this topic - Phosphorylated peptides presented by the common HLA alleles A*02:01 and B*07:02 are differentially expressed by multiple tumor types, exhibit structural fitness due to phosphorylation, and are targets of healthy donor T cell surveillance, but it is not clear, however, whether such features apply to phosphopeptides presented by other common HLA alleles.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds - We investigated the tumor presentation, binding, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides to the prevalent alleles A*03:01, A*11:01, C*07:01, and C*07:02, selected on the basis of their presentation by malignant cells but not normal cells, finding tumor antigens derived from genetic dependencies in lymphomas and leukemias that bind HLA-A3, -A11, -C7 molecules. While we could detect circulating T cell responses in healthy individuals to A*2:01 and A*11:01 phosphopeptides, we did not find such responses to A*03:01 or C*07:01 phosphopeptides, except when utilizing allogeneic donor T cells, indicating that these phosphopeptides may not be immunogenic in an autologous setting but can still be targeted by other means.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - An expanded patient population expressing alleles other than A*02:01 can be addressed through the development of immunotherapies specific for phosphopeptides profiled in the present work, provided the nuances we describe between alleles are taken into consideration.

Numerous CNVs across the Plasmodium falciparum genome contribute directly to drug resistance or impact fitness of this protozoan parasite. CNVs that encompass the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) gene confer resistance to antimalarials that target this enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (i.e. DSM1). During the characterization of DSM1 resistant parasite lines with DHODH CNVs, we detected selection of an additional CNV that encompasses 3 genes (~5 kb) including GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1 amplicon). While this locus has been implicated in increased fitness of antifolate resistant parasites, GCH1 CNVs had not previously been reported to contribute to resistance to other antimalarials. Here, we further explored the association between GCH1 and DHODH copy number. We visualized single long reads and directly quantified the number of tandem GCH1 amplicons in a parental line versus a DSM1-selected line. We found that the GCH1 amplicons share a consistent structure in all lines. However, we detected more reads that encompassed a higher number of amplicons in the resistant (up to 7 amplicons) compared to the parental line (3 amplicons). To better understand the implications of this result, we evaluated variation at this locus across multiple short- and long-read data sets collected from various parasite lines. Based on our analysis of parasites resistant to other DHODH inhibitors (DSM265, DSM267, and DSM705), GCH1 is not likely contributing directly to resistance; however, higher numbers of the GCH1 amplicon are associated with increased DHODH copies and may compensate for changes in metabolism of parasites. This is supported by the direct connection between folate and pyrimidine metabolism, which together contribute to nucleic acid biosynthesis. This study highlights the importance of studying clonal variation and potential biochemical connections as novel antimalarials move closer to clinical approval.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.13.528367,1,new results,2023-02-13,02/13/2023,,Shiwei Liu; Emily R Ebel; Jane Kim; Nnenna Ene; Thomas Werner Anthony Braukmann; Ellen Yeh; Elizabeth S.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, unlike most eukaryotes, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that Haloferax chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.
