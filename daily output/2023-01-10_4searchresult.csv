In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1,new results,2023-01-07,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.

However, the underlying disrupted brain connectome and the neural basis remain unclear. In our current study, 38 first-episode, treatment-naive patients with DMD and 22 matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled and received resting-sate functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Voxel-based degree centrality (DC), seed-based functional connectivity (FC), and clinical correlation were performed. Relative to HC, DMD patients had lower height, full Intellectual Quotients (IQ), and IQ-verbal comprehension. Significant increment of DC of DMD patients were found in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC.L) and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC.R), while decreased DC were found in right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL.R), right precentral/postcentral gyrus (Pre/Postcentral G.R). DMD patients had stronger FC in CPL.R-bilateral lingual gyrus, Pre/Postcentral G.R-Insular, and DMPFC.R-Precuneus.R, had attenuated FC in DLPFC.L-Insular. These abnormally functional couplings were closely associated with the extent of cognitive impairment, suggested an over-activation of default mode network and executive control network, and a suppression of primary sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum-visual circuit.

While the structural features required for conserved autophagy functions of Atg8 are well established, little is known about the molecular changes that facilitated acquisition of divergent, nonautophagic functions of Atg8. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum offers a unique opportunity to study nonautophagic functions of Atg8 family proteins because it encodes a single Atg8 homolog whose only essential function is in the inheritance of an unusual secondary plastid called the apicoplast. Here, we used functional complementation to investigate the structure-function relationship for this divergent Atg8 protein. We showed that the LC3-interacting region (LIR) docking site (LDS), the major interaction interface of the Atg8 protein family, is required for P. falciparum Atg8 (",Atg8; Plasmodium; Toxoplasma; apicomplexan parasites; apicoplast; malaria; nonautophagic function of Atg8,,,,,2023-01-11,2023/01/10,2023/1/11,Marta Walczak; Thomas R Meister; Hoa Mai Nguyen; Yili Zhu; Sébastien Besteiro; Ellen Yeh,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; LPHI UMR5235, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France.","Marta Walczak: Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Thomas R Meister: Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Hoa Mai Nguyen: LPHI UMR5235, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France.Yili Zhu: Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Sébastien Besteiro: LPHI UMR5235, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France.Ellen Yeh: Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.",,,,,,0

Providing haptic feedback of relevant environmental cues to the user or imbuing the prosthesis with autonomous control authority have been separately shown to improve prosthesis utility. Few studies, however, have investigated the effect of combining these two approaches in a shared control paradigm, and none have evaluated such an approach from the perspective of neural efficiency (the relationship between task performance and mental effort measured directly from the brain). In this work, we analyzed the neural efficiency of 30 non-amputee participants in a grasp-and-lift task of a brittle object. Here, a myoelectric prosthesis featuring vibrotactile feedback of grip force and autonomous control of grasping was compared with a standard myoelectric prosthesis with and without vibrotactile feedback. As a measure of mental effort, we captured the prefrontal cortex activity changes using functional near infrared spectroscopy during the experiment. It was expected that the prosthesis with haptic shared control would improve both task performance and mental effort compared to the standard prosthesis. Results showed that only the haptic shared control system enabled users to achieve high neural efficiency, and that vibrotactile feedback was important for grasping with the appropriate grip force. These results indicate that the haptic shared control system synergistically combines the benefits of haptic feedback and autonomous controllers, and is well-poised to inform such hybrid advancements in myoelectric prosthesis technology.",,,,,,2023-01-11,2023/01/10,2023/1/11,Neha Thomas; Alexandra J Miller; Hasan Ayaz; Jeremy D Brown,,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA. neha.thomas@jhmi.edu.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA.; School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Drexel Solutions Institute, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Family and Community Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.","Neha Thomas: Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA. neha.thomas@jhmi.edu.Alexandra J Miller: Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA.Hasan Ayaz: School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Drexel Solutions Institute, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Family and Community Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.Jeremy D Brown: Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA.",,,,,,0
