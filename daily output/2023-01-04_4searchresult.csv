Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,2022-06-17,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

The flagship program of the Alliance partnership is the MU/UCB Biosciences Training Program, an in-country, hands-on workshop model that trains a large number of students from Makerere University in infectious disease and molecular biology research. This approach nucleates training of larger and more diverse groups of students, development of mentoring and bi-directional research partnerships, and support of the local economy.

CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering.

MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets.

We conclude that MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for single-cell gene expression and can identify cell types without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq atlases.",,,,,,2022-12-17,2022/12/16,2022/12/17,Jonathan Liu; Vanessa Tran; Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri; Ashley Byrne; Michael Borja; Yang Joon Kim; Snigdha Agarwal; Ruofan Wang; Kyle Awayan; Abhishek Murti; Aris Taychameekiatchai; Bruce Wang; George Emanuel; Jiang He; John Haliburton; Angela Oliveira Pisco; Norma F Neff,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA norma.neff@czbiohub.org.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Vizgen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.","Jonathan Liu: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Vanessa Tran: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Ashley Byrne: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Michael Borja: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Yang Joon Kim: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Snigdha Agarwal: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Ruofan Wang: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Kyle Awayan: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Abhishek Murti: School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.Aris Taychameekiatchai: School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.Bruce Wang: School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.George Emanuel: Vizgen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.Jiang He: Vizgen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.John Haliburton: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Angela Oliveira Pisco: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Norma F Neff: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA norma.neff@czbiohub.org.",,,,,,0

Here we report intricate crosstalk among the 3 pathways, centered around the SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex of ERAD, in the regulation of organellar organization in β cells. SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD deficiency in β cells triggers activation of autophagy, at least in part, via IRE1α (an endogenous ERAD substrate). In the absence of functional SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, proinsulin is retained in the ER as high molecular weight conformers, which are subsequently cleared via ER-phagy. A combined loss of both SEL1L and autophagy in β cells leads to diabetes in mice shortly after weaning, with premature death by approximately 11 weeks of age, associated with marked ER retention of proinsulin and β cell loss. Using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy powered by deep-learning automated image segmentation and 3D reconstruction, our data demonstrate a profound organellar restructuring with a massive expansion of ER volume and network in β cells lacking both SEL1L and autophagy. These data reveal at an unprecedented detail the intimate crosstalk among the 3 ER quality-control mechanisms in the dynamic regulation of organellar architecture and β cell function.",Autophagy; Cell Biology; Diabetes; Metabolism; Protein misfolding,,,,,2023-01-03,2023/01/03,2022/11/9,Neha Shrestha; Mauricio Torres; Jason Zhang; You Lu; Leena Haataja; Rachel B Reinert; Jeffrey Knupp; Yu-Jie Chen; Gunes Parlakgul; Ana Paula Arruda; Billy Tsai; Peter Arvan; Ling Qi,,"Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, School of Literature, Science, and the Arts, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.","Neha Shrestha: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Mauricio Torres: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Jason Zhang: Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, School of Literature, Science, and the Arts, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.You Lu: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Leena Haataja: Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Rachel B Reinert: Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Jeffrey Knupp: Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Yu-Jie Chen: Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Gunes Parlakgul: Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.Ana Paula Arruda: Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.Billy Tsai: Department of Cell and Development Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Peter Arvan: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Ling Qi: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.",,,,,,0

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

In particular, ferroelastic property, for which the spontaneous strain can be transformed by applying mechanical stress, is very promising for extensive nanotechnological applications. However, integrating ferroelastic property into 2D OIHPs is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed two new 2D OIHPs (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M = Mn for 1 and Cd for 2), which undergo reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with an Aizu expression 4/mmmFmmm. The templating influence of the more distorted inorganic framework on the disordering of organic cations and the stronger hydrogen bonds has a key role in the striking improvement of Curie temperature from 246 K in 1 to 273 K in 2. Meanwhile, the minimized alteration of structural motif ensures the well maintaining of the ferroelastic performance in the forms of crystals and thin films, as demonstrated by the identifiable evolution of domain structures. This work will provide a fertile new ground for enlarging the limited number of 2D ferroelastic OIHPs with better practical utility.",2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites; Curie temperature; ferroelastic nature; spontaneous strain; templating influence,,,,,2023-01-05,2023/01/04,2023/1/5,Ti-Jian Yin; Ke Xu; Lei He; Xin Meng; Yan Xu; Jin-Tiao Men; Jie Mu; Qiong Ye; Ping-Ping Shi,,"Anhui Polytechnic University, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Beijing Road, 241000, Wuhu, CHINA.; Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.","Ti-Jian Yin: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Ke Xu: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Lei He: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Xin Meng: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Yan Xu: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Jin-Tiao Men: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Jie Mu: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Qiong Ye: Southeast University, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 211189, Nanjing, CHINA.Ping-Ping Shi: Anhui Polytechnic University, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Beijing Road, 241000, Wuhu, CHINA.",,,,,,0
