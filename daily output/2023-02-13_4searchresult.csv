Several co-culture formulations were assembled that consisted of anaerobic fungi (Anaeromyces robustus, Neocallimastix californiae, or Caecomyces churrovis) with the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Co-cultures were grown simultaneously (e.g., 'one pot'), and compared to cultures where bacteria were cultured in fungal hydrolysate sequentially. Fungal hydrolysis of lignocellulose resulted in 7-11 mM amounts of glucose and xylose, as well as acetate, formate, ethanol, and lactate to support clostridial growth. Under these conditions, one-stage simultaneous co-culture of anaerobic fungi with C. acetobutylicum promoted the production of butyrate up to 30 mM. Alternatively, two-stage growth slightly promoted solventogenesis and elevated butanol levels (∼4-9 mM). Transcriptional regulation in the two-stage growth condition indicated that this cultivation method may decrease the time required to reach solventogenesis and induce the expression of cellulose-degrading genes in C. acetobutylicum due to relieved carbon-catabolite repression. Overall, this study demonstrates a proof of concept for biobutanol and bio-butyrate production from lignocellulose using an anaerobic fungal-bacterial co-culture system.",Anaerobic fungi; Biofuel; Clostridia; Consortia; RNA-Seq,,,,,2022-11-12,,2022/11/12,Jennifer L Brown; Matthew A Perisin; Candice L Swift; Marcus Benyamin; Sanchao Liu; Vasanth Singan; Yu Zhang; Emily Savage; Christa Pennacchio; Igor V Grigoriev; Michelle A O'Malley,,"Biological and Biotechnology Sciences Division, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783, USA.; Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Rm 3357 Engineering II, Santa Barbara, CA 93117, USA.; Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Rm 3357 Engineering II, Santa Barbara, CA 93117, USA.; Joint BioEnergy Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94608, USA.; US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Jennifer L Brown: Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Rm 3357 Engineering II, Santa Barbara, CA 93117, USA.Matthew A Perisin: Biological and Biotechnology Sciences Division, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783, USA.Candice L Swift: Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Rm 3357 Engineering II, Santa Barbara, CA 93117, USA.Marcus Benyamin: Biological and Biotechnology Sciences Division, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783, USA.Sanchao Liu: Biological and Biotechnology Sciences Division, DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783, USA.Vasanth Singan: US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Yu Zhang: US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Emily Savage: US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Christa Pennacchio: US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Igor V Grigoriev: US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Michelle A O'Malley: Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Rm 3357 Engineering II, Santa Barbara, CA 93117, USA.; Joint BioEnergy Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94608, USA.",,,,,,0

The high affinity of the dense phase to mobile silica precursors generates a diffusive flux against the concentration gradient, similar to dynamic equilibrium, and the resulting high supersaturation leads to precipitation of insoluble silica.

While a distinct autoreactive signature was detected which separates individuals with prior COVID infection from those never exposed to COVID, we did not detect patterns of autoreactivity that separate individuals with Long COVID relative to individuals fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we designed a plasmid-based viral genome assembly and rescue strategy (pGLUE) that constructs complete infectious viruses or noninfectious subgenomic replicons in a single ligation reaction with >80% efficiency. Fully sequenced replicons and infectious viral stocks can be generated in 1 and 3 weeks, respectively. By testing a series of naturally occurring viruses as well as Delta-Omicron chimeric replicons, we show that Omicron nonstructural protein 6 harbors critical attenuating mutations, which dampen viral RNA replication and reduce lipid droplet consumption.

Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, despite responding to different transcription factors, all even-skipped enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their trans-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic even-skipped transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic even-skipped expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping even-skipped bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.09.527927,1,new results,2023-02-10,02/10/2023,,Augusto Berrocal; Nicholas C Lammers; Hernan G Garcia; Michael B Eisen,"Berrocal, A.; Lammers, N.

Phosphopeptides presented in complex with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) have been reported to provide a stability advantage over their unmodified counterparts when presented by the common HLA allele A*02:01. This stability in turn is thought to translate to enhanced immunogenicity. Whether tumor-associated phosphopeptides presented by other common alleles exhibit immunogenicity and structural characteristics similar to those presented by A*02:01 is unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine the identity, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides presented by the common alleles HLA-A*03:01, -A*11:01, -C*07:01, and -C*07:02.

MethodsWe isolated peptide-MHC complexes by immunoprecipitation of 10 healthy and neoplastic tissue samples using mass spectrometry, and then combined the resulting data with public immunopeptidomics datasets to assemble a curated set of phosphopeptides presented by 20 distinct healthy and neoplastic tissue types. We determined the biochemical features of selected phosphopeptides by in vitro binding assays and in silico docking, and their immunogenicity by analyzing healthy donor T cells for phosphopeptide-specific multimer binding and cytokine production.

ResultsWe demonstrated that HLA-A*03:01 and -A*11:01 present shared phosphopeptides on multiple tumor types, particularly lymphomas and leukemias; a subset of these peptides were not found on healthy tissues. These phosphopeptides generally exhibited similar binding to A*11:01 and similar or worse binding to A*03:01 than their unmodified counterparts. Additionally, we found that HLA-C*07:01 phosphopeptides were generally presented in the absence of their unmodified counterparts, and were dependent on B-pocket interactions that were absent in C*07:02, but such interactions were still permissive to unmodified peptide binding. We found that HLA-A*02:01 and -A*11:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cells could be readily detected in an autologous setting, even when the wildtype peptide was co-presented. In contrast, HLA-A*03:01 or -C*07:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cell responses were not elicited in autologous donors, but could be elicited in allogeneic donors.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that phosphopeptides across multiple alleles represent shared tumor-specific antigens that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapy, but the immunogenicity of such phosphopeptides is not a general feature, which may be explained by a lack of increase in energetic favorability associated with phosphopeptide binding to A*03:01. Thus, to address an expanded patient population, phosphopeptide-targeted immunotherapies should be wary of allele-specific differences.

O_LIWhat is already known on this topic - Phosphorylated peptides presented by the common HLA alleles A*02:01 and B*07:02 are differentially expressed by multiple tumor types, exhibit structural fitness due to phosphorylation, and are targets of healthy donor T cell surveillance, but it is not clear, however, whether such features apply to phosphopeptides presented by other common HLA alleles.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds - We investigated the tumor presentation, binding, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides to the prevalent alleles A*03:01, A*11:01, C*07:01, and C*07:02, selected on the basis of their presentation by malignant cells but not normal cells, finding tumor antigens derived from genetic dependencies in lymphomas and leukemias that bind HLA-A3, -A11, -C7 molecules. While we could detect circulating T cell responses in healthy individuals to A*2:01 and A*11:01 phosphopeptides, we did not find such responses to A*03:01 or C*07:01 phosphopeptides, except when utilizing allogeneic donor T cells, indicating that these phosphopeptides may not be immunogenic in an autologous setting but can still be targeted by other means.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - An expanded patient population expressing alleles other than A*02:01 can be addressed through the development of immunotherapies specific for phosphopeptides profiled in the present work, provided the nuances we describe between alleles are taken into consideration.

Together, these scientific and technological advances offer exciting opportunities to deliver high-quality information about early childhood development (ECD) to parents and families globally, which may ultimately lead to greater knowledge and confidence among parents and better outcomes among children (particularly in lower- and middle-income countries). With these potential benefits in mind, we set out to design, develop, implement, and evaluate a new parenting app-Thrive by Five-that will be available in 30 countries. The app will provide caregivers and families with evidence-based and culturally appropriate information about ECD, accompanied by sets of collective actions that go beyond mere tips for parenting practices. Herein, we describe this ongoing global project and discuss the components of our scientific framework for developing and prototyping the app's content. Specifically, we describe (1) 5 domains that are used to organize the content and goals of the app's information and associated practices; (2) 5 neurobiological systems that are relevant to ECD and can be behaviorally targeted to potentially influence social, emotional, and cognitive development; (3) our anthropological and cultural framework for learning about local contexts and appreciating decolonization perspectives; and (4) our approach to tailoring the app's content to local contexts, which involves collaboration with in-country partner organizations and local and international subject matter experts in ECD, education, medicine, psychology, and anthropology, among others.

Given the important role sleep plays in learning and memory, here we extend this work to evaluate whether nightly sleep duration predicts change in end-of-semester grade point average (GPA). First-year college students from three independent universities provided sleep actigraphy for a month early in their winter/spring academic term across five studies. Findings showed that greater early-term total nightly sleep duration predicted higher end-of-term GPA, an effect that persisted even after controlling for previous-term GPA and daytime sleep. Specifically, every additional hour of average nightly sleep duration early in the semester was associated with an 0.07 increase in end-of-term GPA. Sensitivity analyses using sleep thresholds also indicated that sleeping less than 6 h each night was a period where sleep shifted from helpful to harmful for end-of-term GPA, relative to previous-term GPA. Notably, predictive relationships with GPA were specific to total nightly sleep duration, and not other markers of sleep, such as the midpoint of a student's nightly sleep window or bedtime timing variability. These findings across five studies establish nightly sleep duration as an important factor in academic success and highlight the potential value of testing early academic term total sleep time interventions during the formative first year of college.",achievement; college; grade point average; sleep,,,,,2023-02-14,2023/02/13,2023/2/14,J David Creswell; Michael J Tumminia; Stephen Price; Yasaman Sefidgar; Sheldon Cohen; Yiyi Ren; Jennifer Brown; Anind K Dey; Janine M Dutcher; Daniella Villalba; Jennifer Mankoff; Xuhai Xu; Kasey Creswell; Afsaneh Doryab; Stephen Mattingly; Aaron Striegel; David Hachen; Gonzalo Martinez; Marsha C Lovett,,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556.; Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.; Department of Sociology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556.; Paul G.
