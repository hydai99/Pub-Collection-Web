However, how changes in the mechanical properties of the ECM are converted into biochemical signals that direct tumor cell migration and metastasis remains poorly characterized. Here, we describe a new role for the autophagy-inducing serine/threonine kinases ULK1 and ULK2 in mechanotransduction. We demonstrate that ULK1/2 activity inhibits the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (FAs), and as a consequence impedes cell contraction and migration. Mechanistically, we identify PXN/paxillin, a key component of the mechanotransducing machinery, as a direct binding partner and substrate of ULK1/2. ULK-mediated phosphorylation of PXN at S32 and S119 weakens homotypic interactions and liquid-liquid phase separation of PXN, impairing FA assembly, which in turn impedes the mechanotransduction of breast cancer cells. ULK1/2 and the well characterized PXN regulator, FAK/Src, have opposing functions on mechanotransduction and compete for phosphorylation of adjacent serine and tyrosine residues. Thus, our study reveals ULK1/2 as important regulators of PXN-dependent mechanotransduction.

The assembly of MCR is an intricate process involving the installation of a complex set of post-translational modifications and the unique Ni porphyrin cofactor F430. Despite decades of research, details of MCR assembly remain largely unresolved. Here, we report the structural characterization of MCR in two intermediate states of assembly. These intermediate states lack one or both F430 cofactors and form complexes with the previously uncharacterized McrD protein. McrD is found to bind asymmetrically to MCR, displacing large regions of the alpha subunit and increasing active site accessibility for the installation of F430--shedding light on the assembly of MCR and the role of McrD therein. This work offers crucial information for the expression of MCR in a heterologous host and provides new targets for the design of MCR inhibitors.

The origins of tissue specificity in these diseases are unclear, as the A-type Lamins are abundant and broadly expressed proteins. We show that A-type Lamin protein and transcript levels are uncorrelated across tissues. As protein-transcript discordance can be caused by variations in protein lifetime, we applied quantitative proteomics to profile protein turnover rates in healthy and progeroid tissues. We discover that tissue context and disease mutation each influence A-type Lamin protein lifetime. Lamin A/C has a weeks-long lifetime in the aorta, heart, and fat, but a days-long lifetime in tissues spared from disease. Progerin is even more long-lived than Lamin A/C in the cardiovascular system and accumulates there over time. These proteins are insoluble and densely bundled in cardiovascular tissues, which may present an energetic barrier to degradation.

Human tumours can evolve therapy resistance by acquiring de novo genetic alterations and increased heterogeneity via mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1. Here, through parallel analysis of human clinical samples, tumour xenograft and cell line models and murine model systems, we uncover an unanticipated mechanism of therapy-induced adaptation that fuels the evolution of drug resistance. Targeted therapy directed against EGFR and ALK oncoproteins in lung cancer induced adaptations favoring apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)-mediated genome mutagenesis. In human oncogenic EGFR-driven and ALK-driven lung cancers and preclinical models, EGFR or ALK inhibitor treatment induced the expression and DNA mutagenic activity of APOBEC3B via therapy mediated activation of NF-kB signaling. Moreover, targeted therapy also mediated downregulation of certain DNA repair enzymes such as UNG2, which normally counteracts APOBEC-catalyzed DNA deamination events. In mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer mouse models, APOBEC3B was detrimental to tumour initiation and yet advantageous to tumour progression during EGFR targeted therapy, consistent with TRACERx data demonstrating subclonal enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis.

Since echinoderms are defined by morphological novelty, even the most basic axial comparisons with their bilaterian relatives are problematic. Here, we used conserved antero-posterior (AP) axial molecular markers to determine whether the highly derived adult body plan of echinoderms masks underlying patterning similarities with other deuterostomes. To revisit this classical question, we used RNA tomography and in situ hybridizations in the sea star Patiria miniata to investigate the expression of a suite of conserved transcription factors with well-established roles in the establishment of AP polarity in bilaterians. We find that the relative spatial expression of these markers in P. miniata ambulacral ectoderm shows similarity with other deuterostomes, with the midline of each ray representing the most anterior territory and the most lateral parts exhibiting a more posterior identity. Interestingly, there is no ectodermal territory in the sea star that expresses the characteristic bilaterian trunk genetic patterning program. This suggests that from the perspective of ectoderm patterning, echinoderms are mostly head-like animals, and prompts a reinterpretation of the evolutionary trends that made echinoderms the most derived animal group.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.05.527185,1,new results,2023-02-05,02/05/2023,,Laurent Formery; Paul Peluso; Ian Kohnle; Judith Malnick; Mariya Pitel; Kevin Uhlinger; Daniel S.

However, like other optical microscopy tools, a high numerical aperture (N.A.) lens is required to generate a tight focus, generating a narrow depth of field, which necessitates dynamic focusing and limiting the imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a metasurface platform that generates multiple axial foci, which multiplies the volumetric OCT imaging speed by offering several focal planes. This platform offers accurate and flexible control over the number, positions, and intensities of axial foci generated. All-glass metasurface optical elements 8 mm in diameter are fabricated from fused-silica wafers and implemented into our scanning OCT system. With a constant lateral resolution of 1.1 μm over all depths, the multifocal OCT triples the volumetric acquisition speed for dermatological imaging, while still clearly revealing features of stratum corneum, epidermal cells, and dermal-epidermal junctions and offering morphological information as diagnostic criteria for basal cell carcinoma. The imaging speed can be further improved in a sparse sample, e.g., 7-fold with a seven-foci beam. In summary, this work demonstrates the concept of metasurface-based multifocal OCT for rapid virtual biopsy, further providing insights for developing rapid volumetric imaging systems with high resolution and compact volume.",all-glass metasurface; cellular resolution; multifocal beam; noninvasive imaging; optical coherence tomography; phase change materials; virtual biopsy,,,,,2023-02-07,2023/02/06,2023/2/7,Jingjing Zhao; Aidan Van Vleck; Yonatan Winetraub; Lin Du; Yong Han; Sumaira Aasi; Kavita Yang Sarin; Adam de la Zerda,,"Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.; Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.","Jingjing Zhao: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Aidan Van Vleck: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Yonatan Winetraub: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Lin Du: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.Yong Han: Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.Sumaira Aasi: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kavita Yang Sarin: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Adam de la Zerda: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Directional root growth is guided by asymmetric molecular patterns but how these become established or are dynamically regulated is poorly understood. Asymmetric gradients of the phytohormone auxin are established during root gravitropism, mainly through directional transport mediated by polarized auxin transporters. Upon gravistimulation, PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) is differentially distributed and accumulates at the lower root side to facilitate asymmetric auxin transport up to the elongation zone where it inhibits cell elongation. GOLVEN (GLV) peptides function in gravitropism by affecting PIN2 abundance in epidermal cells. In addition, GLV signaling through ROOT GROWTH FACTOR 1 INSENSITIVE (RGI) receptors regulates root apical meristem maintenance. Here, we show that GLV-RGI signaling in these two processes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) can be mapped to different cells in the root tip and that, in the case of gravitropism, it operates mainly in the lateral root cap (LRC) to maintain PIN2 levels at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we found that GLV signaling upregulates the phosphorylation level of PIN2 in an RGI-dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that the RGI5 receptor is asymmetrically distributed in the LRC and accumulates in the lower side of the LRC after gravistimulation. Asymmetric GLV-RGI signaling in the root cap likely accounts for differential PIN2 abundance at the plasma membrane to temporarily support auxin transport up to the elongation zone thereby representing an additional level of control on the asymmetrical auxin flux to mediate differential growth of the root.",GOLVEN peptides; PIN2; RGF peptides; RGI receptors; auxin transport; lateral root cap; root gravitropism,,,,,2023-02-08,2023/02/07,2023/2/8,Ke Xu; Joris Jourquin; Xiangyu Xu; Ive De Smet; Ana I Fernandez; Tom Beeckman,,"Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.","Ke Xu: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.Joris Jourquin: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.Xiangyu Xu: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.Ive De Smet: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.Ana I Fernandez: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.Tom Beeckman: Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Ghent University, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.; VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology, Technologiepark 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",,,,,,0

Due to the large accumulation of training data and low expense, deep learning methods have shown huge potential in determining the specificity of TFs-DNA interactions. Convolutional network-based and self-attention network-based methods have been proposed for transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) prediction. Convolutional operations are efficient to extract local features but easy to ignore global information, while self-attention mechanisms are expert in capturing long-distance dependencies but difficult to pay attention to local feature details. To discover comprehensive features for a given sequence as far as possible, we propose a Dual-branch model combining Self-Attention and Convolution, dubbed as DSAC, which fuses local features and global representations in an interactive way. In terms of features, convolution and self-attention contribute to feature extraction collaboratively, enhancing the representation learning. In terms of structure, a lightweight but efficient architecture of network is designed for the prediction, in particular, the dual-branch structure makes the convolution and the self-attention mechanism can be fully utilized to improve the predictive ability of our model. The experiment results on 165 ChIP-seq datasets show that DSAC obviously outperforms other five deep learning based methods and demonstrate that our model can effectively predict TFBSs based on sequence feature alone. The source code of DSAC is available at https://github.com/YuBinLab-QUST/DSAC/.",convolutional neural network; dual-branch; self-attention mechanism; transcription factor binding sites,,,,,2023-02-08,2023/02/07,2023/2/8,Yutong Yu; Pengju Ding; Hongli Gao; Guozhu Liu; Fa Zhang; Bin Yu,,"College of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.; College of Information Science and Technology, School of Data Science, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.; College of Mathematics and Physics, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.; School of Medical Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China.","Yutong Yu: College of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.Pengju Ding: College of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.Hongli Gao: College of Mathematics and Physics, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.Guozhu Liu: College of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.Fa Zhang: School of Medical Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China.Bin Yu: College of Information Science and Technology, School of Data Science, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, China.",,,,,,0
