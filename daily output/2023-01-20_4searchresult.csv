However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, this work provides a simplified purification scheme for ferritin-based vaccines.",,,,,,2022-08-13,2022/08/12,2022/8/13,Payton Weidenbacher; Sriharshita Musunuri; Abigail E Powell; Shaogeng Tang; Jonathan Do; Mrinmoy Sanyal; Peter S Kim,,"Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.","Payton Weidenbacher: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Sriharshita Musunuri: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Abigail E Powell: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Shaogeng Tang: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Jonathan Do: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Mrinmoy Sanyal: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Peter S Kim: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

The discovery of conserved genes in viruses infecting geographically and phylogenetically diverse hosts has provided important evolutionary context for human and animal pathogens. However, the resulting viral genomes are often incomplete, and analyses largely characterize the distribution of viruses over their dynamics. Here, we show how the accumulated data of metagenomic studies can be integrated to reveal geographic and evolutionary dynamics in a case study of Orthomyxoviridae, the family of RNA viruses containing influenza virus. First, we use sequences of the orthomyxovirid W[u]han mosquito virus 6 to track the global migrations of its host. We then look at overall orthomyxovirus genome evolution, finding significant gene gain and loss across members of the family, especially in the surface proteins responsible for cell and host tropism. We find that the surface protein of W[u]han mosquito virus 6 exhibits accelerated non-synonymous evolution suggestive of antigenic evolution, and an entire quaranjavirid group bearing highly diverged surface proteins. Finally we quantify the progress of orthomyxovirus discovery and forecast that many highly diverged Orthomyxoviridae members remain to be found. We argue that continued metagenomic studies will be fruitful for understanding the dynamics, evolution, ecology of viruses and their hosts, regardless of whether novel viruses are actually identified or not, as long as study designs allowing for the resolution of complete viral genomes are employed.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.31.505987,3,new results,2023-01-16,01/16/2023,,Gytis Dudas; Joshua Batson,"Dudas, G.; Batson, J.","Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub","Gytis Dudas, Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University], [Joshua Batson, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",NA,,,,,0

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.

Statement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.

We analyzed data from 93 ARDS patients with sepsis enrolled in a multi-center prospective cohort of critically ill patients, comparing 970 metabolites between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. 188 metabolites were differentially abundant between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. After adjusting for age, sex, confounding medications, and comorbid liver and kidney disease, 82 metabolites remained significantly different. Hyperinflammatory ARDS patients had reduced circulating lipids but high levels of pyruvate, lactate, and malate. Metabolic cluster and LCA-derived phenotypes were each significantly and independently associated with survival. Hyperinflammatory ARDS patients may be experiencing a glycolytic shift leading to dysregulated lipid metabolism.

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts. Our pipeline of genome-wide association studies with disease liabilities can be applied to other biobanks with rich phenotype and genotype data.",,,medrxiv;2023.01.18.23284383,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2023-01-19,01/19/2023,,Lu Yang; Marie C Sadler; Russ B Altman,"Yang, L.; Sadler, M.

Adaptation to a genetically homogeneous host population should theoretically result in specialization, while adaptation to an evolving host population (i.e., coevolution) can result in various outcomes including diversification, range expansion, and/or local adaptation. For viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages), our understanding of how evolutionary history of the bacterial host(s) impacts viral genotypic and phenotypic evolution is currently limited. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and two different metrics of phage impacts to compare the genotypes and phenotypes of lytic phages that had either coevolved with or were repeatedly passaged on an unchanging (ancestral) strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Genomes of coevolved phages had more mutations than those of phages passaged on a constant host, and most mutations were in genes encoding phage tail-associated proteins. Phages from both passaging treatments shared some phenotypic outcomes, including range expansion and divergence across replicate populations, but coevolved phages were more efficient at reducing population growth (particularly of sympatric coevolved hosts). Genotypic similarity correlated with infectivity profile similarity in coevolved phages, but not in phages passaged on the ancestral host. Overall, while adaptation to either host type (coevolving or ancestral) led to divergence in phage tail proteins and infectivity patterns, coevolution led to more rapid molecular changes that increased bacterial killing efficiency and had more predictable effects on infectivity range. Together, these results underscore the important role of hosts in driving viral evolution and in shaping the genotype-phenotype relationship.",bacteriophage evolution; evolutionary history; experimental evolution; genotype-phenotype relationship; plant pathogen,,,,,2023-01-19,2023/01/18,2023/1/19,Catherine A Hernandez; Véronique A Delesalle; Greg Krukonis; Jenna DeCurzio; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.; Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Catherine A Hernandez: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Véronique A Delesalle: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Greg Krukonis: Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.Jenna DeCurzio: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,,,,0

Resetting TAMs by simple, efficacious and safe approach(s) is highly desirable to enhance antitumor immunity and attenuate tumor cell malignancy. Previously, we used tumor cell-derived microparticles to package chemotherapeutic drugs (drug-MPs), which resulted in a significant treatment outcome in human malignant pleural effusions via neutrophil recruitments, implicating that drug-MPs might reset TAMs, considering the inhibitory effects of M2 macrophages on neutrophil recruitment and activation. Here, we show that drug-MPs can function as an antitumor immunomodulator by resetting TAMs with M1 phenotype and IFN-β release. Mechanistically, drug molecules in tumor MPs activate macrophage lysosomal P450 monooxygenases, resulting in superoxide anion formation, which further amplifies lysosomal ROS production and pH value by activating lysosomal NOX2.

By screening genes that regulate ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the p53 proteins in mice, we found that ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B) represses axonal regrowth in retinal ganglion cells and corticospinal neurons. We found that axonal regrowth induced by UBE4B depletion depended on the cooperative activation of p53 and mTOR. Importantly, overexpression of UbV.E4B, a competitive inhibitor of UBE4B, in corticospinal neurons promoted corticospinal axon sprouting and facilitated the recovery of corticospinal axon-dependent function in a cortical stroke model.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation across archaeal ribosomes in the peptidyl transferase center that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,,,,2023-01-21,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Amos J Nissley; Petar I Penev; Zoe L Watson; Jillian F Banfield; Jamie H D Cate,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Amos J Nissley: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Petar I Penev: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Zoe L Watson: California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jamie H D Cate: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.",,,,,,0

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway. Our work presents a powerful method for mapping PTM networks, a large dataset of GSK3 kinase substrates, and important insights into the signaling network that controls key cellular functions underlying plant growth and acclimation.",,,,,,2023-01-21,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Tae-Wuk Kim; Chan Ho Park; Chuan-Chih Hsu; Yeong-Woo Kim; Yeong-Woo Ko; Zhenzhen Zhang; Jia-Ying Zhu; Yu-Chun Hsiao; Tess Branon; Krista Kaasik; Evan Saldivar; Kevin Li; Asher Pasha; Nicholas J Provart; Alma L Burlingame; Shou-Ling Xu; Alice Y Ting; Zhi-Yong Wang,,"Department of Cell & Systems Biology/Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada.; Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Research Institute for Convergence of Basic Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.; Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.","Tae-Wuk Kim: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Research Institute for Convergence of Basic Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.Chan Ho Park: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Chuan-Chih Hsu: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.Yeong-Woo Kim: Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.Yeong-Woo Ko: Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.Zhenzhen Zhang: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Jia-Ying Zhu: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Yu-Chun Hsiao: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Tess Branon: Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Krista Kaasik: Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.Evan Saldivar: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Kevin Li: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Asher Pasha: Department of Cell & Systems Biology/Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada.Nicholas J Provart: Department of Cell & Systems Biology/Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada.Alma L Burlingame: Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.Shou-Ling Xu: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Alice Y Ting: Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Zhi-Yong Wang: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.",,,,,,0

Apart from the well-defined diabetic retinopathy, disturbed optic nerve function, which is dependent on the myelin sheath, has recently been recognized as an early feature of visual impairment in diabetes. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Using a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model, we observed a myelin deficiency along with a disturbed composition of oligodendroglial lineage cells in diabetic optic nerve. We found that new myelin deposition, a continuous process that lasts throughout adulthood, was diminished during pathogenesis. Genetically dampening newly generated myelin by conditionally deleting olig2 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells within this short time window extensively delayed the signal transmission of the adult optic nerve. In addition, clemastine, an antimuscarinic compound that enhances myelination, significantly restored oligodendroglia, and promoted the functional recovery of the optic nerve in diabetic mice. Together, our results point to the role of new myelin deposition in optic neuropathy under diabetic insult and provide a promising therapeutic target for restoring visual function.",clemastine; diabetes mellitus; myelination; oligodendroglia; optic nerve,,,,,2023-01-21,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Haoqian Wu; Xianjun Chen; Bin Yu; Jieqiong Zhang; Xingmei Gu; Wei Liu; Feng Mei; Jian Ye; Lan Xiao,,"Department of Histology and Embryology, Brain and Intelligence Research Key Laboratory of Chongqing Education Commission, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Neurosurgery, 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Neurosurgery, 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Histology and Embryology, Brain and Intelligence Research Key Laboratory of Chongqing Education Commission, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Ophthalmology, Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Physiology, Research Center of Neuroscience, College of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.","Haoqian Wu: Department of Ophthalmology, Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Xianjun Chen: Department of Physiology, Research Center of Neuroscience, College of Basic Medical Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.Bin Yu: Department of Neurosurgery, 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Jieqiong Zhang: Department of Ophthalmology, Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Xingmei Gu: Department of Histology and Embryology, Brain and Intelligence Research Key Laboratory of Chongqing Education Commission, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Wei Liu: Department of Ophthalmology, Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Feng Mei: Department of Histology and Embryology, Brain and Intelligence Research Key Laboratory of Chongqing Education Commission, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Jian Ye: Department of Ophthalmology, Daping Hospital, Army Medical Center, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.Lan Xiao: Department of Neurosurgery, 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Histology and Embryology, Brain and Intelligence Research Key Laboratory of Chongqing Education Commission, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.",,,,,,0

In this switching program, C. albicans reversibly alternates between two cell types, named ""white"" and ""opaque,"" each of which is normally stable across thousands of cell divisions. Although switching under most conditions is stochastic and rare, certain environmental signals or genetic manipulations can dramatically increase the rate of switching. Here, we report the identification of two new inputs which affect white-to-opaque switching rates. The first, exposure to sub-micromolar concentrations of (E,E)-farnesol, reduces white-to-opaque switching by ten-fold or more. The second input, an inferred PKA phosphorylation of residue T208 on the transcriptional regulator Efg1, increases white-to-opaque switching ten-fold.
