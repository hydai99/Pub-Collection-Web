Using bioinformatics and chemoproteomics, we identify serine hydrolases in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that are specific to the Bacteroidetes phylum. Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling. Functional studies reveal that BT4193 is a true homolog of hDPP4 while the other is misannotated and is a proline-specific triaminopeptidase. We demonstrate that BT4193 is important for envelope integrity and is inhibited by FDA-approved type 2 diabetes drugs that target hDPP4. Loss of BT4193 reduces B. thetaiotaomicron fitness during in vitro growth within a diverse community. Taken together, our findings suggest that serine hydrolases contribute to gut microbiota dynamics and may be off-targets for existing drugs that could cause unintended impact on the microbiota.",,10.1101/2022.07.25.501481,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.25.501481v1,2022.07.25.501481,2022-07-26,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemical & Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Divisions of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University; Institute of Organic Chemistry and Macromolecular Chemistry, Friedrich- Schiller-Universität; Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center; Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California","Department of Chemical & Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Institute of Organic Chemistry and Macromolecular Chemistry, Friedrich- Schiller-Universität; Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Divisions of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University; Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center; Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Divisions of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University; Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,1

In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far. We generated and analysed such mutants and describe a connection between AARE function, aggregation of oxidized proteins and plant ageing, including accelerated developmental progression and reduced life span.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression. This study demonstrates that single-cell genomics and machine learning can generate a mechanistic model for how disruptions in cell communication selectively affect spatiotemporally dynamic regulatory networks in cardiogenesis.",,10.1101/2022.07.25.501458,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.25.501458v1,2022.07.25.501458,2022-07-25,,"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, UCSF School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone","Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, UCSF School of Medicine; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California",,,1

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

We leverage multiple published datasets to show that Scriabin recovers expected CCC edges and use spatial transcriptomic data, genetic perturbation screens, and direct experimental manipulation of receptor-ligand interactions to validate that the recovered edges are biologically meaningful. We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of CCC from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues. Thus ACE+ macrophages have differential capacity to serve as cellular niche for intracellular bacteria to establish persistent infection.Teaser This study shows that ACE+ granuloma macrophages have restricted capacity to act as a cellular niche that enables intracellular bacterial persistence.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.501041,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501041v1,2022.07.21.501041,2022-07-22,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,1

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites.

Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors. These findings suggest that engagement in sport may benefit the brain across numerous domains, but also highlights the potentially damaging effects of concussive head injury.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.22277627,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/22/2022.07.21.22277627.1,2022.07.21.22277627,2022-07-22,,"Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF)","The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London",,,1

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease.",35896747,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4,,,2022-07-27,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.5 Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.",,,2022 Jul 27.,1

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Disruption of both mTOR complexes leads to pronounced deficits in dopamine release demonstrating the importance of balanced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling for dopaminergic function.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.

We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches.

Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells.
