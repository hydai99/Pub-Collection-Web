To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.

Significance StatementDevelopment of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.04.502752,2,new results,01/08/2022,01/08/2022,,"Skinner, W.

We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties.

Thekey insight to our approach is to plan an action sequence that maximizes theexpected information gain about the optimal trajectory for the task at hand. Wedemonstrate that our method learns strong policies with 2x fewer samples thanstrong exploration baselines and 200x fewer samples than model free methods ona diverse set of low-to-medium dimensional control tasks in both the open-loopand closed-loop control settings.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04642,arXiv:2210.04642v1,,,10/06/2022,10/06/2022,,,"Viraj Mehta, Ian Char, Joseph Abbate, Rory Conlin, Mark D.

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action tothe AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promisingdirections for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI.

Neural networkscan assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manualannotations, while unsupervised approaches have fared poorly in ultrasound todate. Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labelsrequired) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinicaldomain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements. We also tested our pipeline againstexternal images from an additional 10,030 patients (20,060 images) withavailable manual tracings of the left ventricle. Results: r2 between clinicallymeasured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reportedinter-clinician variation for LVESV and LVEDV (pipeline vs. clinical r2= 0.74and r2=0.65, respectively), LVEF and LV mass (r2= 0.46 and r2=0.54), left andright atrium volumes (r2=0.7 and r2=0.6), and right ventricle area (r2=0.47).When binarized into normal vs. abnormal categories, average accuracy was 0.81(range 0.71-0.95). A subset of the test echocardiograms (n=553) hadcorresponding cardiac MRI; correlation between pipeline and CMR measurementswas similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and CMR. Finally, in theexternal dataset, our pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with anaverage Dice score of 0.83 (95% CI 0.83).

A lack of suitable model systems limits the mechanistic understanding of telomere shortening in the stem cells and thus hinders the development of treatment options for BM failure. Here, we endogenously introduced TIN2-DC mutations in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to dissect the disease mechanism and identify a gene-editing strategy that rescued the disease phenotypes. The hESCs with the T284R disease mutation exhibited the short telomere phenotype observed in DC patients. Yet, telomeres in mutant hESCs did not trigger DNA damage responses at telomeres or show exacerbated telomere shortening when differentiated into telomerase-negative cells. Disruption of the mutant TINF2 allele by introducing a frameshift mutation in exon 2 restored telomere length in stem cells and the replicative potential of differentiated cells. Similarly, we introduced TIN2-DC disease variants in human HSPCs to assess the changes in telomere length and proliferative capacity. Lastly, we showed that editing at exon 2 of TINF2 that restored telomere length in hESCs could be generated in TINF2-DC patient HSPCs. Our study demonstrates a simple genetic intervention that rescues the TIN2-DC disease phenotype in stem cells and provides a versatile platform to assess the efficacy of potential therapeutic approaches in vivo.",,,,,,2022/4/15/6/0,,2022/4/15/6/0,Seunga Choo ; Franziska K Lorbeer ; Samuel G Regalado ; Sarah B Short ; Shannon Wu ; Gabrielle Rieser ; Alison A Bertuch ; Dirk Hockemeyer,,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.;Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; and.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.;Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.","Seunga Choo: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.Franziska K Lorbeer: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.Samuel G Regalado: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.Sarah B Short: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.Shannon Wu: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.Gabrielle Rieser: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.Alison A Bertuch: Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.Dirk Hockemeyer: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; and.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.",,,,,,,0,"Pollard, Katie; Srivastava, Deepak"

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.",Ets ; Ets21C ; blastema ; gene regulatory network ; imaginal disc ; regeneration ; scRNA-seq ; tissue damage ; transcription factor ; tumors,,,,,2022/7/13/6/0,2022/07/11,2022/7/13/6/0,Melanie I Worley ; Nicholas J Everetts ; Riku Yasutomi ; Rebecca J Chang ; Shrey Saretha ; Nir Yosef ; Iswar K Hariharan,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts.

Thus, we created the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset-the first publicly available, expertly curated, and pathologically confirmed image dataset with diverse skin tones. We show that state-of-the-art dermatology AI models exhibit substantial limitations on the DDI dataset, particularly on dark skin tones and uncommon diseases. We find that dermatologists, who often label AI datasets, also perform worse on images of dark skin tones and uncommon diseases.

Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products. Biosynthesis of THP and papaverine has not been achieved to date, in part because multiple pathway enzymes have not been elucidated. Here, we describe the development of an engineered yeast strain for de novo biosynthesis of THP.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene in Culex mosquitoes are associated with knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. RNAseq was used to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. The cDNA sequences were used to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F kdr mutation in the Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay was used successfully in six Culex spp. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. The L1014F kdr mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and was more prevalent in mosquitoes collected near farmland. The Culex RTkdr assay takes advantage of the RNA that vector control agencies routinely isolate to assess arbovirus prevalence in mosquitoes.
