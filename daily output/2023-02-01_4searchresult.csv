Thematic analysis was adopted for data analysis. Five themes were generated: the nature of professional bereavement experiences, the meaning of patient deaths, immediate bereavement reactions, long-term changes, and coping strategies. Each theme included personal and professional dimensions. Professional bereavement experiences in Mainland China were found to be influenced by workplace violence against professional caregivers, traditional Chinese medical ethics, the strong death taboo, and inadequacies of the healthcare system. Professional bereavement experiences are meaning-driven, comprehensive, and usually disenfranchised. They involve multidimensional reactions and have both short-term and long-lasting, both event-specific and accumulated impacts. Cultural and systemic factors could shape professional bereavement experiences.",Mainland China; nurses; physicians; professional bereavement; qualitative description,,,,,2021-02-04,2021/02/02,2021/2/4,Chuqian Chen; Amy Yin Man Chow; Ke Xu,,"Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Medical Humanities, School of Humanities, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.; Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.","Chuqian Chen: Department of Medical Humanities, School of Humanities, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.Amy Yin Man Chow: Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.Ke Xu: Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.",,,,,,0

Although SiNPs are generally thought to be benign, recent studies have demonstrated toxicity in different cell and animal models. Despite their ubiquitous use, SiNPs are rarely analyzed quantitatively. Often, the methods used to analyze silicon and SiNPs are difficult, costly, require the use of dangerous reagents, and are prone to interferences. Additionally, characterization of SiNPs in complex matrices requires extensive sample preparation.

In this study, 11 types of PAH and nitro-PAH standard samples were analyzed using a high performance-single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (HP-SPAMS) in lab studies. The identification principles 'parent ions' and 'mass-to-charge (m/z) = 77' of each compound were obtained in this study. It was found that different laser energies did not affect the identification of the parent ions. The comparative experiments of ambient atmospheric particles, cooking and biomass burning emitted particles with and without the addition of PAHs were conducted and ruled out the interferences from primary and secondary organics on the identification of PAHs. Besides, the reliability of the characteristic ions extraction method was evaluated through the comparative study of similarity algorithm and deep learning algorithm. In addition, the real PAH-containing particles from vehicle exhaust emissions and ambient particles were also analyzed.

These transfers are applicable to only cases with low spinal segment injuries (sacral nerve root function is lost) and largely preserved lumbar function. Transfer of the posterior branch of the obturator nerve to the vesical branch of the pelvic nerve provides a feasible mechanism for patients to initiate detrusor contraction by thigh adduction. External urethra innervation (motor and sensory) may be accomplished by transfer of the vastus medialis nerve to the pudendal nerve. The sensory component of the pudendal nerve to the genitalia may be further enhanced by transfer of the saphenous nerve (sensory) to the pudendal nerve.

Approximately 1.4% of patients develop a serious adverse event called post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS), characterised by drowsiness, anticholinergic and extrapyramidal symptoms. The objective is to investigate olanzapine PDSS presentations including clinical features and treatment approach. This is a retrospective review of olanzapine PDSS patients from three toxicology units and the NSW Poisons Information Centre between 2017 and 2022. Adult patients were included if they had intramuscular olanzapine then developed PDSS criteria. Clinical symptoms, treatment, timing and length of symptoms were extracted into a preformatted Excel database. There were 18 patients included in the series, with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38-58) and male predominance (89%). Median onset time post injection was 30 min (IQR: 11-38). PDSS symptoms predominate with drowsiness, confusion and dysarthria. Median length of symptoms was 24 h (IQR: 20-54). Most common treatment included supportive care without any pharmacological intervention (n = 10), benzodiazepine (n = 4) and benztropine (n = 3). In one case, bromocriptine and physostigmine followed by oral rivastigmine were given to manage antidopaminergic and anticholinergic symptoms respectively. This proposed treatment combination could potentially alleviate some of the symptoms but needs further studies to validate the findings. In conclusion, this case series supports the characterisation of PDSS symptomology predominantly being anticholinergic with similar onset (<1 h) and duration (<72 h). Bromocriptine is proposed to manage PDSS if patients develop severe dopamine blockade and physostigmine followed by rivastigmine for anticholinergic delirium.",PDSS; depot antipsychotic; drug reaction; olanzapine pamoate; schizophrenia,,,,,2022-11-20,2022/11/20,2022/11/10,Jason Seebaluck; Michael A Downes; Jared Brown; Keith Harris; Katherine Z Isoardi; Betty S Chan,,"Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, NSW, Australia.; New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.; Clinical Toxicology Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.; Department of Emergency Medicine & Clinical Toxicology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.; Department of Emergency Medicine & Clinical Toxicology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.; New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.; Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia.; New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.; New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.; Clinical Toxicology Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.","Jason Seebaluck: Department of Emergency Medicine & Clinical Toxicology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.Michael A Downes: Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, NSW, Australia.; New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.Jared Brown: New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.Keith Harris: Clinical Toxicology Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.Katherine Z Isoardi: New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.; Clinical Toxicology Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.Betty S Chan: Department of Emergency Medicine & Clinical Toxicology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia.; New South Wales Poisons Information Centre, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia.; Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,0

This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) affecting the proliferation and myelinating activity of SCs.

Results demonstrated that LIPUS with a duty ratio of 50 % showing the maximal effect in facilitating proliferation of SCs. The expressions of Krox20 and myelin basic protein (MBP), the key molecules of SC myelination, and the potent inducer of myelination neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptors ErbB2 and ErbB3 increased significantly by LIPUS. The reaction of these factors to LIPUS were both time- and duty ratio-dependent: namely LIPUS with higher duty ratios took effects when applied repeatedly over more consecutive days. These observations indicated that NRG1/ErbB signaling pathway might contribute to the effects of LIPUS on the proliferation and myelinating status of SCs, which could be one of the mechanisms in the protective role of LIPUS in nerve repair and regeneration.

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the Prosite database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites. These methods demonstrate that COLLAPSE is computationally efficient, tunable, and interpretable, providing a general-purpose platform for computational protein analysis.",deep learning; functional site annotation; protein structure analysis; representation learning; structural informatics,,,,,2022-12-16,,2022/12/16,Alexander Derry; Russ B Altman,,"Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Departments of Bioengineering, Genetics, and Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.","Alexander Derry: Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.Russ B Altman: Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Departments of Bioengineering, Genetics, and Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.",,,10.1101/2022.07.20.500713,,,0

Here, we show that increasing the local concentration of MPER-directed bNAbs at the cell surface via binding to the high-affinity Fc receptor FcγRI potentiates their ability to prevent viral entry in a manner analogous to the previously reported observation wherein the lipid-binding activity of MPER bNAbs increases their concentration at the viral surface membrane. However, binding of MPER-directed bNAb 10E8 to FcγRI abolishes the neutralization synergy that is seen with the N-heptad repeat (NHR)-targeting antibody D5_AR and NHR-targeting small molecule enfuvirtide (T20), possibly due to decreased accessibility of the NHR in the FcγRI-10E8-MPER complex. Taken together, our results suggest that lipid-binding activity and FcγRI-mediated potentiation function in concert to improve the potency of MPER-directed bNAbs by increasing their local concentration near the site of viral fusion. Therefore, lipid binding may not be a strict requirement for potent neutralization by MPER-targeting bNAbs, as alternative methods can achieve similar increases in local concentrations while avoiding potential liabilities associated with immunologic host tolerance.

This provides a proof-of-concept that 3D primary cultures may be useful to model tumor heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that high-density 3D cultures can be used to test chemotherapy response within a 2-3-week timeframe and are predictive of patient response to Temozolomide therapy.

However, the dynamics of this process are difficult to characterize in dominant gut species in their complex in vivo environment. Here we show that the fine-scale dynamics of genome-wide transposon libraries can enable quantitative inferences of these in vivo evolutionary forces. By analyzing >400,000 lineages across four human Bacteroides strains in gnotobiotic mice, we observed positive selection on thousands of previously hidden mutations - most of which were unrelated to their original gene knockouts. The spectrum of fitness benefits varied between species, and displayed diverse tradeoffs over time and in different dietary conditions, enabling inferences of their underlying function. These results suggest that within-host adaptations arise from an intense competition between numerous contending mutations, which can strongly influence their emergent evolutionary tradeoffs.",,,biorxiv;2022.05.13.491573,2,new results,2023-01-27,01/27/2023,,Daniel P.G.H.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) among users of pegfilgrastim biosimilars (pegfilgrastim-jmdb and pegfilgrastim-cbqv) and the originator product. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using 2019 IBM MarketScan databases to assess comparative effectiveness of pegfilgrastim originator and biosimilars for prevention of FN among patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Patients with cancer, including breast, lung, colorectal, esophageal and gastric, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, initiating myelosuppressive chemotherapy courses were selected. We further selected patients who used pegfilgrastim originator and biosimilars within 3 days of chemotherapy completion. FN-associated hospitalizations were measured by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. After 1:1 propensity score matching, we used equivalence (with a margin of 6%) hypothesis tests to compare FN-related hospitalization risk in the first cycle and across all cycles between biosimilars and originator users. RESULTS: A total of 2,045 patients were included, of which 445 (21.8%) used pegfilgrastim-jmdb, 636 (31.1%) used pegfilgrastim-cbqv, and 964 (47.1%) used pegfilgrastim originator. After matching, 13 out of 445 originator users and 17 out of 445 pegfilgrastim-jmdb users developed FN after the first chemotherapy cycle (risk difference was 0.9%; P < 0.001 for equivalence test indicating statistical equivalence). After matching, 14 out of 633 originator users and 16 out of 633 pegfilgrastim-cbqv users developed FN (risk difference was 0.32%; P < 0.001 for equivalence test indicating statistical equivalence). Results across all cycles (including the first cycle) were consistent with that in the first cycle. CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world study of patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there was no difference in FN risk between patients receiving pegfilgrastim originator and biosimilars in the first cycle and across all cycles. These results add further to the current evidence on pegfilgrastim biosimilars and support wider adoption of pegfilgrastim biosimilars among payers, providers, and patients.

Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the ""proton wire"" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.25.525534,2,new results,2023-01-31,01/31/2023,,Chandrima Majumdar; Joshua A Walker; Matthew B Francis; Alanna Schepartz; Jamie H.

In this study, we conducted a systematic review of prevalence and concentrations of fecal indicator microorganisms (i.e., E. coli, fecal coliform) and enteric pathogens on hands. We identified eighty-four studies, reporting 35,440 observations of hand contamination of people in community or household settings. The studies investigated 44 unique microorganisms, of which the most commonly reported indicators were E. coli and fecal coliforms. Hand contamination with 12 unique enteric pathogens was reported, with adenovirus and norovirus as the most frequent. Mean E. coli prevalence on hands was 62% [95% CI 40%-82%] and mean fecal coliform prevalence was 66% [95% CI 22%-100%]. Hands were more likely to be contaminated with E. coli in low/lower-middle-income countries (prevalence: 69% [95% CI 48% - 88%]) than in upper-middle/high-income countries (6% [95% CI 2% - 12%]).

Interestingly, such 'nonclassical' mineralization pathways are widespread in biological systems, even though concentrating molecules well beyond their saturation level is incompatible with cellular homeostasis. Here, we show how polymer phase separation can facilitate bioinspired silica formation by passively concentrating the inorganic building blocks within the polymer dense phase. The high affinity of the dense phase to mobile silica precursors generates a diffusive flux against the concentration gradient, similar to dynamic equilibrium, and the resulting high supersaturation leads to precipitation of insoluble silica. Manipulating the chemistry of the dense phase allows to control the delicate interplay between polymer chemistry and silica precipitation.
