A comprehensive, retrospective medical history survey was distributed to parents of children with confirmed CFC in collaboration with CFC International, Inc. Data were collected on CFC gene variant, maternal characteristics, pregnancy course, delivery, and neonatal outcomes with the support of medical records. We identified 43 individuals with pathogenic variants in BRAF (81%), MEK1 (14%), or MEK2 (5%) genes. The median age was 8.5 years. Hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia occurred in 5/43 (12%), 4/43 (9%), 3/43 (7%), and 3/43 (7%) of pregnancies, respectively. Second and third trimester ultrasound abnormalities included polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, macrosomia, and renal and cardiac abnormalities. Delivery occurred via spontaneous vaginal, operative vaginal, or cesarean delivery in 15/42 (36%), 7/42 (16%), and 20/42 (48%), respectively. Median gestational age at delivery was 37 weeks and median birth weight was 3501 grams. Germline pathogenic vaiants had mutiple congenital consequences including polyhydramnios, renal and cardiac abnormalities, macrosomia, and macrocephaly on second and third trimester ultrasound. Elevated rates of operative delivery and neonatal complications were also noted.

Here, we show that increasing the local concentration of MPER-directed bNAbs at the cell surface via binding to the high-affinity Fc receptor FcγRI potentiates their ability to prevent viral entry in a manner analogous to the previously reported observation wherein the lipid-binding activity of MPER bNAbs increases their concentration at the viral surface membrane. However, binding of MPER-directed bNAb 10E8 to FcγRI abolishes the neutralization synergy that is seen with the N-heptad repeat (NHR)-targeting antibody D5_AR and NHR-targeting small molecule enfuvirtide (T20), possibly due to decreased accessibility of the NHR in the FcγRI-10E8-MPER complex. Taken together, our results suggest that lipid-binding activity and FcγRI-mediated potentiation function in concert to improve the potency of MPER-directed bNAbs by increasing their local concentration near the site of viral fusion. Therefore, lipid binding may not be a strict requirement for potent neutralization by MPER-targeting bNAbs, as alternative methods can achieve similar increases in local concentrations while avoiding potential liabilities associated with immunologic host tolerance.

Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the ""proton wire"" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.25.525534,2,new results,2023-01-31,01/31/2023,,Chandrima Majumdar; Joshua A.

For increased controllability, multi-input switches that integrate several cooperating and competing signals for the regulation of a shared output are of particular interest. The nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily offers promising starting points for engineering multi-input-controlled responses to clinically approved drugs. Starting from the VgEcR/RXR pair, we demonstrate that novel (multi-)drug regulation can be achieved by exchange of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) ligand binding domain (LBD) for other human NHR-derived LBDs. For responses activated to saturation by an agonist for the first LBD, we show that outputs can be boosted by an agonist targeting the second LBD. In combination with an antagonist, output levels are tunable by up to three simultaneously present small-molecule drugs.

We identified eighty-four studies, reporting 35,440 observations of hand contamination of people in community or household settings. The studies investigated 44 unique microorganisms, of which the most commonly reported indicators were E. coli and fecal coliforms. Hand contamination with 12 unique enteric pathogens was reported, with adenovirus and norovirus as the most frequent. Mean E. coli prevalence on hands was 62% [95% CI 40%-82%] and mean fecal coliform prevalence was 66% [95% CI 22%-100%]. Hands were more likely to be contaminated with E. coli in low/lower-middle-income countries (prevalence: 69% [95% CI 48% - 88%]) than in upper-middle/high-income countries (6% [95% CI 2% - 12%]).

This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.",intermittent fasting; liver; mouse; regeneration; regenerative medicine; stem cells,,,,,2023-02-01,2023/01/31,2023/2/1,Abby Sarkar; Yinhua Jin; Brian C DeFelice; Catriona Y Logan; Yan Yang; Teni Anbarchian; Peng Wu; Maurizio Morri; Norma F Neff; Huy Nguyen; Eric Rulifson; Matthew Fish; Avi Gurion Kaye; Azalia M Martínez Jaimes; Roel Nusse,,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.","Abby Sarkar: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Yinhua Jin: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Brian C DeFelice: Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.Catriona Y Logan: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Yan Yang: Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Teni Anbarchian: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Peng Wu: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Maurizio Morri: Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.Norma F Neff: Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.Huy Nguyen: Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Eric Rulifson: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Matthew Fish: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Avi Gurion Kaye: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Azalia M Martínez Jaimes: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Roel Nusse: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.",,,,,,0

Here we sought to further understand the effects of idelalisib and duvelisib in vitro, and demonstrate that both idelalisib and duvelisib can inhibit T cell proliferation as well as Th1 and Treg differentiation in vitro, while promoting Th2 and Th17 differentiation.
