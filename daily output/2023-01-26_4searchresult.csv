Vedolizumab (VDZ) is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody that is effective for treating UC. VDZ is thought to primarily inhibit lymphocyte trafficking to the intestine, but its effect on other cell subsets is less well characterized. To identify the inflammatory cells that contribute to colitis and respond to VDZ, we performed a single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of peripheral blood and colonic biopsies in healthy controls (HC) and patients with UC on either aminosalicylates or VDZ. We identified mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as a primary target of VDZ, with comparatively modest effects on lymphocytes. Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics demonstrated increased density and proximity of MNP and fibroblast subsets in UC biopsies when compared to HC, with inhibition by VDZ. VDZ non-responders were enriched for activated fibroblast and MNP signatures in a validation cohort.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.21.525036,1,new results,2023-01-22,01/22/2023,,Elvira Mennillo; Yang Joon Kim; Iulia Rusu; Gyehyun Lee; Leah C.

Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Escherichia coli (Eco) with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis. Together, our study highlights the consequences of co-regulating essential pathways on recipient fitness during interbacterial competition, and how antibacterial toxins leverage cellular vulnerabilities that are both direct and indirect to their specific targets in vivo.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.20.524922,2,new results,2023-01-23,01/23/2023,,Kristine L Trotta; Beth M Hayes; Johannes P Schneider; Jing Wang; Horia Todor; Patrick Rockefeller Grimes; Ziyi Zhao; William L Hatleberg; Melanie R Silvis; Rachel Kim; Byoung Mo Koo; Marek Basler; Seemay Chou,"Trotta, K.

Despite the commercial value of limonoids, a complete biosynthetic route has not been described. We report the discovery of 22 enzymes, including a pair of neofunctionalized sterol isomerases, that catalyze 12 distinct reactions in the total biosynthesis of kihadalactone A and azadirone, products that bear the signature limonoid furan.

Striking features of Borg genomes are pervasive tandem direct repeat (TR) regions. Here, we present six new Borg genomes and investigate the characteristics of TRs in all ten complete Borg genomes. We find that TR regions are rapidly evolving, recently formed, arise independently, and are virtually absent in host Methanoperedens genomes. Flanking partial repeats and A-enriched character constrain the TR formation mechanism. TRs can be in intergenic regions, where they might serve as regulatory RNAs, or in open reading frames (ORFs). TRs in ORFs are under very strong selective pressure, leading to perfect amino acid TRs (aaTRs) that are commonly intrinsically disordered regions. Proteins with aaTRs are often extracellular or membrane proteins, and functionally similar or homologous proteins often have aaTRs composed of the same amino acids. We propose that Borg aaTR-proteins functionally diversify Methanoperedens and all TRs are crucial for specific Borg-host associations and possibly cospeciation.",,,,,,2023-01-27,2023/01/26,2023/1/27,Marie Charlotte Schoelmerich; Rohan Sachdeva; Jacob West-Roberts; Lucas Waldburger; Jillian F Banfield,,"Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, United States of America.","Marie Charlotte Schoelmerich: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.Rohan Sachdeva: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.Jacob West-Roberts: Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.Lucas Waldburger: Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, United States of America.",,,,,,0
