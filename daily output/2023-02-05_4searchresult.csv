A comprehensive, retrospective medical history survey was distributed to parents of children with confirmed CFC in collaboration with CFC International, Inc. Data were collected on CFC gene variant, maternal characteristics, pregnancy course, delivery, and neonatal outcomes with the support of medical records. We identified 43 individuals with pathogenic variants in BRAF (81%), MEK1 (14%), or MEK2 (5%) genes. The median age was 8.5 years. Hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia occurred in 5/43 (12%), 4/43 (9%), 3/43 (7%), and 3/43 (7%) of pregnancies, respectively. Second and third trimester ultrasound abnormalities included polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, macrosomia, and renal and cardiac abnormalities. Delivery occurred via spontaneous vaginal, operative vaginal, or cesarean delivery in 15/42 (36%), 7/42 (16%), and 20/42 (48%), respectively. Median gestational age at delivery was 37 weeks and median birth weight was 3501 grams. Germline pathogenic vaiants had mutiple congenital consequences including polyhydramnios, renal and cardiac abnormalities, macrosomia, and macrocephaly on second and third trimester ultrasound. Elevated rates of operative delivery and neonatal complications were also noted.

Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the ""proton wire"" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.25.525534,2,new results,2023-01-31,01/31/2023,,Chandrima Majumdar; Joshua A.

For increased controllability, multi-input switches that integrate several cooperating and competing signals for the regulation of a shared output are of particular interest. The nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily offers promising starting points for engineering multi-input-controlled responses to clinically approved drugs. Starting from the VgEcR/RXR pair, we demonstrate that novel (multi-)drug regulation can be achieved by exchange of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) ligand binding domain (LBD) for other human NHR-derived LBDs. For responses activated to saturation by an agonist for the first LBD, we show that outputs can be boosted by an agonist targeting the second LBD. In combination with an antagonist, output levels are tunable by up to three simultaneously present small-molecule drugs.

The studies investigated 44 unique microorganisms, of which the most commonly reported indicators were E. coli and fecal coliforms. Hand contamination with 12 unique enteric pathogens was reported, with adenovirus and norovirus as the most frequent. Mean E. coli prevalence on hands was 62% [95% CI 40%-82%] and mean fecal coliform prevalence was 66% [95% CI 22%-100%].

We demonstrate that ULK1/2 activity inhibits the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (FAs), and as a consequence impedes cell contraction and migration. Mechanistically, we identify PXN/paxillin, a key component of the mechanotransducing machinery, as a direct binding partner and substrate of ULK1/2. ULK-mediated phosphorylation of PXN at S32 and S119 weakens homotypic interactions and liquid-liquid phase separation of PXN, impairing FA assembly, which in turn impedes the mechanotransduction of breast cancer cells. ULK1/2 and the well characterized PXN regulator, FAK/Src, have opposing functions on mechanotransduction and compete for phosphorylation of adjacent serine and tyrosine residues. Thus, our study reveals ULK1/2 as important regulators of PXN-dependent mechanotransduction.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.03.526950,1,new results,2023-02-03,02/03/2023,,Peigang Liang; Jiaqi Zhang; Yuchen Wu; Shanyuan Zheng; Zhaopeng Xu; Shuo Yang; Jinfang Wang; Suibin Ma; Li Xiao; Tianhui Wu; Wenxue Jiang; Qiong Xing; Mondira Kundu; Bo Wang,"Liang, P.; Zhang, J.; Wu, Y.; Zheng, S.; Xu, Z.; Yang, S.; Wang, J.; Ma, S.; Xiao, L.; Wu, T.; Jiang, W.; Xing, Q.; Kundu, M.; Wang, B.","Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Xiamen University;; Hubei University;; State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Green Transformation of Bio-Resources, Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University;; St Jude Children's Research Hospital; Xiamen University;","Peigang Liang, Xiamen University;], [Jiaqi Zhang, Xiamen University;], [Yuchen Wu, Xiamen University;], [Shanyuan Zheng, Xiamen University;], [Zhaopeng Xu, Xiamen University;], [Shuo Yang, Xiamen University;], [Jinfang Wang, Xiamen University;], [Suibin Ma, Xiamen University;], [Li Xiao, Xiamen University;], [Tianhui Wu, Xiamen University;], [Wenxue Jiang, Hubei University;], [Qiong Xing, State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Green Transformation of Bio-Resources, Hubei Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University;], [Mondira Kundu, ""St Jude Childrens Research Hospital""], [Bo Wang, Xiamen University;",NA,,,,,0

The assembly of MCR is an intricate process involving the installation of a complex set of post-translational modifications and the unique Ni porphyrin cofactor F430. Despite decades of research, details of MCR assembly remain largely unresolved. Here, we report the structural characterization of MCR in two intermediate states of assembly. These intermediate states lack one or both F430 cofactors and form complexes with the previously uncharacterized McrD protein. McrD is found to bind asymmetrically to MCR, displacing large regions of the alpha subunit and increasing active site accessibility for the installation of F430--shedding light on the assembly of MCR and the role of McrD therein. This work offers crucial information for the expression of MCR in a heterologous host and provides new targets for the design of MCR inhibitors.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.01.526716,1,new results,2023-02-03,02/03/2023,,Grayson L Chadwick; Aaron MN Joiner; Sangeetha Ramesh; Douglas A Mitchell; Dipti D Nayak,"Chadwick, G.

The origins of tissue specificity in these diseases are unclear, as the A-type Lamins are abundant and broadly expressed proteins. We show that A-type Lamin protein and transcript levels are uncorrelated across tissues. As protein-transcript discordance can be caused by variations in protein lifetime, we applied quantitative proteomics to profile protein turnover rates in healthy and progeroid tissues. We discover that tissue context and disease mutation each influence A-type Lamin protein lifetime. Lamin A/C has a weeks-long lifetime in the aorta, heart, and fat, but a days-long lifetime in tissues spared from disease. Progerin is even more long-lived than Lamin A/C in the cardiovascular system and accumulates there over time. These proteins are insoluble and densely bundled in cardiovascular tissues, which may present an energetic barrier to degradation. We reveal that human disease alleles are significantly over-represented in the long-lived proteome. These findings indicate that gene therapy interventions will have significant latency and limited potency in disrupting long-lived disease-linked proteins such as Progerin.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.04.527139,1,new results,2023-02-04,02/04/2023,,John Hasper; Kevin Welle; Kyle Swovick; Jennifer Hryhorenko; Sina Ghaemmaghami; Abigail Buchwalter,"Hasper, J.; Welle, K.; Swovick, K.; Hryhorenko, J.; Ghaemmaghami, S.; Buchwalter, A.","University of California, San Francisco;; University of Rochester; University of Rochester; University of Rochester; University of Rochester; University of California, San Francisco;","John Hasper, University of California, San Francisco;], [Kevin Welle, University of Rochester], [Kyle Swovick, University of Rochester], [Jennifer Hryhorenko, University of Rochester], [Sina Ghaemmaghami, University of Rochester], [Abigail Buchwalter, University of California, San Francisco;",NA,,,,,0

Since echinoderms are defined by morphological novelty, even the most basic axial comparisons with their bilaterian relatives are problematic. Here, we used conserved antero-posterior (AP) axial molecular markers to determine whether the highly derived adult body plan of echinoderms masks underlying patterning similarities with other deuterostomes. To revisit this classical question, we used RNA tomography and in situ hybridizations in the sea star Patiria miniata to investigate the expression of a suite of conserved transcription factors with well-established roles in the establishment of AP polarity in bilaterians. We find that the relative spatial expression of these markers in P. miniata ambulacral ectoderm shows similarity with other deuterostomes, with the midline of each ray representing the most anterior territory and the most lateral parts exhibiting a more posterior identity. Interestingly, there is no ectodermal territory in the sea star that expresses the characteristic bilaterian trunk genetic patterning program. This suggests that from the perspective of ectoderm patterning, echinoderms are mostly head-like animals, and prompts a reinterpretation of the evolutionary trends that made echinoderms the most derived animal group.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.05.527185,1,new results,2023-02-05,02/05/2023,,Laurent Formery; Paul Peluso; Ian Kohnle; Judith Malnick; Mariya Pitel; Kevin Uhlinger; Daniel S.
