We present the setup and results of the ""Hacking the Human Body"" machine learning algorithm development competition hosted by the Human Biomolecular Atlas (HuBMAP) and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) teams on the Kaggle platform. We showcase how 1,175 teams from 78 countries engaged in community- driven, open-science code development that resulted in machine learning models which successfully segment anatomical structures across five organs using histology images from two consortia and that will be productized in the HuBMAP data portal to process large datasets at scale in support of Human Reference Atlas construction. We discuss the benchmark data created for the competition, major challenges faced by the participants, and the winning models and strategies.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.05.522764,1,new results,2023-01-06,01/06/2023,,Yashvardhan Jain; Leah L.

Multiple pathways involved in normal brain development are dysfunctional in infected NPCs but how ZIKV centrally reprograms these pathways remains unknown. Here we show that ZIKV infection disrupts subcellular partitioning of host transcripts critical for neurodevelopment in NPCs and functionally link this process to the up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). UPF1 is an RNA-binding protein known to regulate decay of cellular and viral RNAs and is less expressed in ZIKV-infected cells. Using infrared crosslinking immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing (irCLIP-Seq), we show that a subset of mRNAs loses UPF1 binding in ZIKV-infected NPCs, consistent with UPF1's diminished expression. UPF1 target transcripts, however, are not altered in abundance but in subcellular localization, with mRNAs accumulating in the nucleus of infected or UPF1 knockdown cells. This leads to diminished protein expression of FREM2, a protein required for maintenance of NPC identity. Our results newly link UPF1 to the regulation of mRNA transport in NPCs, a process perturbed during ZIKV infection.",,,,,,2023-01-06,2023/01/05,2023/1/6,Kristoffer E Leon; Mir M Khalid; Ryan A Flynn; Krystal A Fontaine; Thong T Nguyen; G Renuka Kumar; Camille R Simoneau; Sakshi Tomar; David Jimenez-Morales; Mariah Dunlap; Julia Kaye; Priya S Shah; Steven Finkbeiner; Nevan J Krogan; Carolyn Bertozzi; Jan E Carette; Melanie Ott,,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.; Departments of Chemical Engineering and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Davis, California, United States of America.; J.

Pollard,,,Michael Alexanian,Gladstone Institute,bioRxiv,10.1101/2023.01.06.522937,,Chromatin Remodeling Drives Immune-Fibroblast Crosstalk in Heart Failure Pathogenesis,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.06.522937v1,"Chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis are common stress responses that worsen organ function, yet the molecular mechanisms governing their crosstalk are poorly understood. In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1,new results,2023-01-07,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.
