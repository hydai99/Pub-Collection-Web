Using proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, we identified Numb as a new ciliary protein that positively regulates Hh signaling. Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket and acts as an endocytic adaptor to incorporate Ptch1 into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby promoting Ptch1 exit from the cilium, a key step in Hh signaling activation. Numb loss impaired Sonic Hedgehog-induced Ptch1 departure from the cilium, resulting in severe attenuation of Hh signaling. Genetic ablation of Numb and its homolog Numblike in the developing cerebellum impaired the proliferation of granule cell precursors, a Hh-dependent process, resulting in reduced cerebellar size. This study demonstrates a key function of Numb in controlling protein levels in the cilium, and highlights Numbs critical role in the regulation of Hh signaling.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.10.511655,3,new results,01/11/2022,01/11/2022,,Xiaoliang Liu; Patricia T.

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo. In the future, TRAIL can be used to explore how environment, aging, and disease affect tissue homeostasis.",,,biorxiv;2022.04.24.488979,3,new results,01/12/2022,01/12/2022,,John Hasper; Kevin Welle; Jennifer Hryhorenko; Sina Ghaemmaghami; Abigail Buchwalter,"Hasper, J.; Welle, K.

Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 15 human organ donors, 20 tissues, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the healthy human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution. In order to construct this atlas, we developed a computational pipeline which identifies high-confidence microbial sequences from three domains of life within the sea of human transcripts in individual cells, and show that this is a non-trivial search for one in a million sequences. Together with data from a separate validation cohort of 8 additional donors, we identify more than a thousand diverse bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. In characterizing the human tissue microbiome, we demonstrate that individuals harbor unique species associated not just with each tissue but often with particular cell types, and that many of these species remain uncharacterized. Moreover, combining our data with the Human Microbiome Project, the tumor microbiome dataset by Nejman et al., and the PATRIC database, we map the likely microbial flow routes from external-facing microbiomes to internal tissues and tumors, and show the existence of many unexpected routes taken by both commensals and pathogens. We find that [~]30% of bacterial species found in tumors are detectable across healthy tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from healthy tissues, even those from distant sites. Increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantify the microbial load and diversity across different cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells.

We used sensitivity analyses and bias analyses to explore such discrepancies in a study of the indirect effects of influenza vaccination.

MethodsWe fit an age-structured, deterministic, compartmental model to estimate indirect effects of a school-based influenza vaccination program in California that was evaluated in a previous matched cohort study. To understand discrepancies in their results, we used 1) a model with constrained parameters such that projections matched the cohort study; and 2) probabilistic bias analyses to identify potential biases (e.g., outcome misclassification due to incomplete influenza testing) that, if corrected, would align the empirical results with the mathematical model.

ResultsThe indirect effect estimate (% reduction in influenza hospitalization among older adults in intervention vs. control) was 22.3% (95% CI 7.6% - 37.1%) in the cohort study but only 1.6% (95% Bayesian credible intervals 0.4 - 4.4%) in the mathematical model. When constrained, mathematical models aligned with the cohort study when there was substantially lower pre-existing immunity among school-age children and older adults. Conversely, empirical estimates corrected for potential bias aligned with mathematical model estimates only if influenza testing rates were 15-23% lower in the intervention vs. comparison site.

ConclusionsSensitivity and bias analysis can shed light on why results of mathematical models and empirical epidemiologic studies differ for the same research question, and in turn, can improve study and model design.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280870,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/13/2022,01/13/2022,,Nimalan Arinaminpathy; Carrie Reed; Matthew Biggerstaff; Anna Nguyen; Tejas S.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",,,biorxiv;2021.07.01.450475,2,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,Chengkun Wang; Ravi K.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in agin, but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell specific Hmgcl deficient mice fed a high-fat diet.

As obligate pathogens of erythrocytes, the Plasmodium spp. parasites that cause malaria must exploit erythroid host factors for their survival. However, our understanding of this important aspect of the malaria lifecycle is limited, in part because erythrocytes are enucleated cells that lack a nucleus and DNA, rendering them genetically intractable. Recent advances in genetic analysis of the erythroid lineage using small-hairpin RNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) in red-blood cells derived from stem cells have generated new insights into the functions of several candidate host factors for Plasmodium parasites. Along with efforts in other hematopoietic cells, these advances have also laid a strong foundation for genetic screens to identify novel erythrocyte host factors for malaria.",,,,,,2022/10/16/6/0,2022/10/12,2022/10/16/6/0,Marilou Tetard ; Nana A Peterson ; Elizabeth S Egan,,"Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Our data point to roles for both systemic factors acting on lung endothelial cells and viral infection of endothelial cells in COVID-19-associated endotheliopathy.",COVID-19 ; acute respiratory distress syndrome ; endothelial permeability ; lung endothelial injury,,,,,2022/6/2/6/0,,2022/6/2/6/0,"Jérémie Joffre ; Lauren Rodriguez ; Zachary A Matthay ; Elliot Lloyd ; Alexander T Fields ; Roland J Bainton ; Philip Kurien ; Anita Sil ; Carolyn S Calfee ; Prescott G Woodruff ; David J Erle ; Carolyn Hendrickson ; Matthew F Krummel ; Charles R Langelier ; Michael A Matthay ; Lucy Z Kornblith ; Judith Hellman ; COVID-19 Multi-Phenotyping for Effective Therapies (COMET) Consortium ; COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy, Inflammation, and Thrombosis (Co-ACIT) Study Group",,";CoLabs.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.;Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.; CoLabs.;Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.;Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California.;Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.;Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.;ImmunoX Initiative.; Department of Pathology.","Jérémie Joffre: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Lauren Rodriguez: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.; CoLabs.Zachary A Matthay: Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.Elliot Lloyd: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Alexander T Fields: Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.Roland J Bainton: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Philip Kurien: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Anita Sil: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.Carolyn S Calfee: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.Prescott G Woodruff: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.David J Erle: CoLabs.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.Carolyn Hendrickson: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.Matthew F Krummel: ImmunoX Initiative.; Department of Pathology.Charles R Langelier: Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California.Michael A Matthay: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.Lucy Z Kornblith: Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.Judith Hellman: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.COVID-19 Multi-Phenotyping for Effective Therapies (COMET) Consortium: COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy, Inflammation, and Thrombosis (Co-ACIT) Study Group: ",,,,,,0
