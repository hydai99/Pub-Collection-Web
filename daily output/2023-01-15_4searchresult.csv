We sought new inhibitors of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) activity of Nsp14 with three large library docking strategies. First, up to 1.1 billion make-on-demand (tangible) lead-like molecules were docked against the enzyme SAM site, seeking reversible inhibitors. On de novo synthesis and testing, three inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 43 M, each with novel chemotypes. Structure-guided optimization and in vitro characterization supported their non-covalent mechanism. In a second strategy, docking a library of 16 million tangible fragments revealed nine new inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 341 M and ligand efficiencies from 0.29 to 0.42. In a third strategy, a newly created library of 25 million tangible, virtual electrophiles were docked to covalently modify Cys387 in the SAM binding site. Seven inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 3.2 to 39 M, the most potent being a reversible aldehyde. Initial optimization of a second series yielded a 7 M acrylamide inhibitor. Three inhibitors characteristic of the new series were tested for selectivity against 30 human protein and RNA MTases, with one showing partial selectivity and one showing high selectivity. Overall, 32 inhibitors encompassing eleven chemotypes had IC50 values <50 M and 5 inhibitors in four chemotypes had IC50 values <10 M. These molecules are among the first non-SAM-like inhibitors of Nsp14, providing multiple starting points for optimizing towards antiviral activity.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.12.523677,1,new results,2023-01-13,01/13/2023,,Isha Singh; Fengling Li; Elissa Fink; Irene Chau; Alice Li; Annia Rodriguez-Hernandez; Isabella Glenn; Francisco J Zapatero-Belinchon; Mario Rodriguez; Kanchan Devkota; Zhijie Deng; Kris White; Xiaobo Wan; Nataliya A Tolmachova; Yurii S Moroz; H.

Community membership was largely determined by the donor feces, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient, due to the ability of fast-growing organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities.

Using the antibody sequences of B cells, we tracked clones during in vitro differentiation. Clonal analysis revealed a subset of IgM+ B cells which were more proliferative than other B-cell types. Whereas the population of B cells adopted diverse states during differentiation, clones had a restricted set of fates available to them; there were two times more single-fate clones than expected given population-level cell-type diversity. This implicated a molecular memory of initial cell states that was propagated through differentiation. We then identified the genes which had strongest coherence within clones. These genes significantly overlapped known B-cell fate determination programs, suggesting the genes which determine cell identity are most robustly controlled on a clonal level. Persistent clonal identities were also observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, indicating that these transcriptional programs maintain long-term cell identities in vivo.
