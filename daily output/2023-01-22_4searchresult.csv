In a study of iron supplementation in healthy humans, we identified gradual microbiota shifts in some participants correlated with bacterial iron internalization. To identify direct effects due to taxon-specific iron sensitivity, we used participant stool samples to derive diverse in vitro communities. Iron supplementation of these communities caused small compositional shifts, mimicking those in vivo, whereas iron deprivation dramatically inhibited growth with irreversible, cumulative reduction in diversity and replacement of dominant species. Sensitivity of individual species to iron deprivation in axenic culture generally predicted iron dependency in a community. Finally, exogenous heme acted as a source of inorganic iron to prevent depletion of some species.

However, surveillance mechanisms that specifically respond to stalled ribosomes with an occluded A site have not been identified. We discovered that the elongation factor-1α (eEF1A) inhibitor, ternatin-4, triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of eEF1A on stalled ribosomes. Using a chemical genetic approach, we unveiled a signaling network comprising two E3 ligases, RNF14 and RNF25, which are required for eEF1A degradation. Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role by engaging RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates eEF1A. The site-specific, RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein RPS27A/eS31 provides a second essential signaling input.

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.

Statement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts.

Adaptation to a genetically homogeneous host population should theoretically result in specialization, while adaptation to an evolving host population (i.e., coevolution) can result in various outcomes including diversification, range expansion, and/or local adaptation. For viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages), our understanding of how evolutionary history of the bacterial host(s) impacts viral genotypic and phenotypic evolution is currently limited. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and two different metrics of phage impacts to compare the genotypes and phenotypes of lytic phages that had either coevolved with or were repeatedly passaged on an unchanging (ancestral) strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Genomes of coevolved phages had more mutations than those of phages passaged on a constant host, and most mutations were in genes encoding phage tail-associated proteins. Phages from both passaging treatments shared some phenotypic outcomes, including range expansion and divergence across replicate populations, but coevolved phages were more efficient at reducing population growth (particularly of sympatric coevolved hosts). Genotypic similarity correlated with infectivity profile similarity in coevolved phages, but not in phages passaged on the ancestral host. Overall, while adaptation to either host type (coevolving or ancestral) led to divergence in phage tail proteins and infectivity patterns, coevolution led to more rapid molecular changes that increased bacterial killing efficiency and had more predictable effects on infectivity range. Together, these results underscore the important role of hosts in driving viral evolution and in shaping the genotype-phenotype relationship.",bacteriophage evolution; evolutionary history; experimental evolution; genotype-phenotype relationship; plant pathogen,,,,,2023-01-19,2023/01/18,2023/1/19,Catherine A Hernandez; Véronique A Delesalle; Greg Krukonis; Jenna DeCurzio; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.; Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Catherine A Hernandez: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Véronique A Delesalle: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Greg Krukonis: Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.Jenna DeCurzio: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,,,,0

Here, we image dopamine modulation in striatal brain tissue slices with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCat) and implement machine learning to determine which features of dopamine modulation are unique to changes in stimulation strength, and to different neuroanatomical regions. We trained a support vector machine and a random forest classifier to determine whether recordings were made from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) versus the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and find that machine learning is able to accurately distinguish dopamine release that occurs in DLS from that occurring in DMS in a manner unachievable with canonical statistical analysis. Furthermore, our analysis determines that dopamine modulatory signals including the number of unique dopamine release sites and peak dopamine released per stimulation event are most predictive of neuroanatomy yet note that integrated neuromodulator amount is the conventional metric currently used to monitor neuromodulation in animal studies. Lastly, our study finds that machine learning discrimination of different stimulation strengths or neuroanatomical regions is only possible in adult animals, suggesting a high degree of variability in dopamine modulatory kinetics during animal development.

Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli (Eco) genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Eco with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis. Together, our study highlights the consequences of co-regulating essential pathways on recipient fitness during interbacterial competition, and how antibacterial toxins leverage cellular vulnerabilities that are both direct and indirect to their specific targets in vivo.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.20.524922,1,new results,2023-01-21,01/21/2023,,Kristine L Trotta; Beth Hayes; Johaness P Schneider; Jing Wang; Horia Todor; Patrick R Grimes; Ziyi Zhao; William Hatleberg; Melanie Silvis; Rachel Kim; Byoung-Mo Koo; Marek Basler; Seemay Chou,"Trotta, K.

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway. Our work presents a powerful method for mapping PTM networks, a large dataset of GSK3 kinase substrates, and important insights into the signaling network that controls key cellular functions underlying plant growth and acclimation.",,,,,,2023-01-21,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Tae-Wuk Kim; Chan Ho Park; Chuan-Chih Hsu; Yeong-Woo Kim; Yeong-Woo Ko; Zhenzhen Zhang; Jia-Ying Zhu; Yu-Chun Hsiao; Tess Branon; Krista Kaasik; Evan Saldivar; Kevin Li; Asher Pasha; Nicholas J Provart; Alma L Burlingame; Shou-Ling Xu; Alice Y Ting; Zhi-Yong Wang,,"Department of Cell & Systems Biology/Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada.; Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Research Institute for Convergence of Basic Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.; Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.","Tae-Wuk Kim: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.; Research Institute for Convergence of Basic Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.Chan Ho Park: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Chuan-Chih Hsu: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.Yeong-Woo Kim: Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.Yeong-Woo Ko: Department of Life Science, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, South Korea.Zhenzhen Zhang: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Jia-Ying Zhu: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Yu-Chun Hsiao: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Tess Branon: Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Krista Kaasik: Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.Evan Saldivar: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Kevin Li: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Asher Pasha: Department of Cell & Systems Biology/Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada.Nicholas J Provart: Department of Cell & Systems Biology/Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3B2, Canada.Alma L Burlingame: Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.Shou-Ling Xu: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Alice Y Ting: Departments of Genetics, Biology, and Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Zhi-Yong Wang: Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.",,,,,,0

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation across archaeal ribosomes in the peptidyl transferase center that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,,,,2023-01-21,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Amos J Nissley; Petar I Penev; Zoe L Watson; Jillian F Banfield; Jamie H D Cate,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Amos J Nissley: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Petar I Penev: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Zoe L Watson: California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jamie H D Cate: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.",,,,,,0

Vedolizumab (VDZ) is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody that is effective for treating UC. VDZ is thought to primarily inhibit lymphocyte trafficking to the intestine, but its effect on other cell subsets is less well characterized. To identify the inflammatory cells that contribute to colitis and respond to VDZ, we performed a single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of peripheral blood and colonic biopsies in healthy controls (HC) and patients with UC on either aminosalicylates or VDZ. We identified mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as a primary target of VDZ, with comparatively modest effects on lymphocytes. Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics demonstrated increased density and proximity of MNP and fibroblast subsets in UC biopsies when compared to HC, with inhibition by VDZ.
