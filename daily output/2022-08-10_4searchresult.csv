Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-{kappa}B inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more I{kappa}B expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B that I{kappa}B usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable I{kappa}B mutant reduced NF-{kappa}B translocation and increased viral infection. These data demonstrate the functionality of ACE2-OE organoids in SARS-CoV-2 research and identify an incomplete NF-{kappa}B feedback loop as a rheostat of viral infection that may promote inflammation and severe disease.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.02.502100,1,new results,01/02/2022,01/02/2022,,"Simoneau, C.

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.

MethodsThe gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.

ResultsVariation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.

ConclusionsThe observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.30.502150,1,new results,01/02/2022,01/02/2022,,"Officer, A.; Dempsey, A.

Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat.

We found 4 common COSMIC mutation signatures (1, 2, 3, 13) and signature 16 not previously reported in other breast-cancer datasets. We observed recurrent amplifications in breast-cancer drivers including MYC, FGFR1, CCND1, and ERBB2, and a recurrent amplification on 17q11.2 associated with high KIAA0100 gene expression, implicated in breast-cancer aggressiveness.

While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers.

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-{kappa}B, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNF, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs.

We use the atlas to explore the biology and function of the lemur immune system, including the expression profiles across the organism of all MHC genes and chemokines in health and disease, and the mapping of neutrophil and macrophage development, trafficking, and activation, their local and global responses to infection, and primate-specific aspects of the program. We characterize other examples of primate-specific physiology and disease such as unique features of lemur adipocytes that may underlie their dramatic seasonal rhythms, and spontaneous metastatic endometrial cancer that models the human gynecological malignancy. We identify and describe the organism-wide expression profiles of over 400 primate genes missing in mice, some implicated in human disease. Thus, an organism-wide molecular cell atlas and molecular cell autopsies can enhance gene discovery, structure definition, and annotation in a new model organism, and can identify and elucidate primate-specific genes, physiology, diseases, and evolution.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.06.503035,1,new results,01/07/2022,01/07/2022,,"The Tabula Microcebus Consortium,  ; Ezran, C.; Liu, S.; Ming, J.; Guethlein, L.

Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy. In combination with signaling and simulation data, this study provides mechanistic insights into CB1 activation by different classes of ligands, and sheds light on the G protein preferences between endogenous and exogenous ligands.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.06.502185,1,new results,01/07/2022,01/07/2022,,"Krishna Kumar, K.; Robertson, M.

To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.

Significance StatementDevelopment of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.04.502752,2,new results,01/08/2022,01/08/2022,,"Skinner, W.

We developa unified mathematical model that quantitatively describes the transcriptomescale response of myeloid and lymphoid cell types to individual drugs and drugcombinations through a single inferred regulatory network. The mathematicalmodel reveals how drug combinations generate novel, macrophage and T-cellstates by recruiting combinations of gene expression programs through bothadditive and non-additive drug interactions.

In recent years, manyadvancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines,and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especiallycomplex polygonal geometries. In this work, we focus on developing ageneral-purpose polygon encoding model, which can encode a polygonal geometry(with or without holes, single or multipolygons) into an embedding space. Theresult embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream taskssuch as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. Toachieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirableproperties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutationinvariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties. We conductexperiments on two tasks: 1) shape classification based on MNIST; 2) spatialrelation prediction based on two new datasets - DBSR-46K and DBSR-cplx46K.

In thispaper, we instead consider a generalization of Shannon entropy from work instatistical decision theory (DeGroot 1962, Rao 1984), which contains a broadclass of uncertainty measures parameterized by a problem-specific loss functioncorresponding to a downstream task.

In thiswork, we develop a method that allows us to plan for exploration while takingboth the task and the current knowledge about the dynamics into account.

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action tothe AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promisingdirections for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI.

Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements.

DVP links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context. By individually excising nuclei from cell culture, we classified distinct cell states with proteomic profiles defined by known and uncharacterized proteins. In an archived primary melanoma tissue, DVP identified spatially resolved proteome changes as normal melanocytes transition to fully invasive melanoma, revealing pathways that change in a spatial manner as cancer progresses, such as mRNA splicing dysregulation in metastatic vertical growth that coincides with reduced interferon signaling and antigen presentation.

An open question is whether these sex differences reflect men's generally poorer health and lower life expectancy compared to women of similar ages or if men face a unique COVID-19 disadvantage. Using age-specific data on COVID-19 mortality as well as cause-specific and all-cause mortality for 63 countries, we compared the sex difference in COVID-19 mortality to sex differences in all-cause mortality and mortality from other common causes of death to determine the magnitude of the excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19. We found that sex differences in the age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rate were substantially larger than for the age-standardized all-cause mortality rate and mortality rate for most other common causes of death. The excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19 was especially large in the oldest age groups. Our findings suggest that the causal pathways that link male sex to a higher mortality from a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be specific to SARS-CoV-2, rather than shared with the pathways responsible for the shorter life expectancy among men or sex differences for other common causes of death.

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion.

Although the number of e-cigarette users has been increasing, the potential health impacts and biological effects of e-cigarettes are still not fully understood. Previous research has focused on the biological effects of e-cigarettes on lung cancer cell lines and distal airway epithelial cells; however, there have been few published studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on primary lung alveolar epithelial cells. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effect of e-cigarette aerosol on primary human lung alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, both alone and in the presence of viral infection. The Melo-3 atomizer caused direct AT2 cell toxicity, whereas the more popular Juul pod's aerosol did not have a detectable cytotoxic effect on AT2 cells. Juul nicotine aerosol also did not increase short-term susceptibility to viral infection. However, 3 days of exposure upregulated genes central to the generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carcinogen metabolism and downregulated key innate immune system genes related to cytokine and chemokine signaling. These findings have implications for the potentially injurious impact of long-term use of popular low-power e-cigarette pods on the human alveolar epithelium.

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",,,,,,2022/7/12/6/0,2022/07/11,2022/7/12/6/0,Jacob W Freimer ;

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.",Ets ; Ets21C ; blastema ; gene regulatory network ; imaginal disc ; regeneration ; scRNA-seq ; tissue damage ; transcription factor ; tumors,,,,,2022/7/13/6/0,2022/07/11,2022/7/13/6/0,Melanie I Worley ; Nicholas J Everetts ; Riku Yasutomi ; Rebecca J Chang ; Shrey Saretha ; Nir Yosef ; Iswar K Hariharan,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.",Omicron ; SARS-CoV-2 ; virus-like particles,,,,,2022/7/21/6/0,2022/07/19,2022/7/21/6/0,Abdullah M Syed ; Alison Ciling ; Taha Y Taha ; Irene P Chen ; Mir M Khalid ; Bharath Sreekumar ; Pei-Yi Chen ; G Renuka Kumar ; Rahul Suryawanshi ; Ines Silva ; Bilal Milbes ; Noah Kojima ; Victoria Hess ; Maria Shacreaw ; Lauren Lopez ; Matthew Brobeck ; Fred Turner ; Lee Spraggon ; Takako Tabata ; Melanie Ott ; Jennifer A Doudna,,"Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.;Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.;Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.;Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.;Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.;Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.;Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; HHMI, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.;Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232.","Abdullah M Syed: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.Alison Ciling: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.Taha Y Taha: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Irene P Chen: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.Mir M Khalid: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Bharath Sreekumar: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Pei-Yi Chen: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232.G Renuka Kumar: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Rahul Suryawanshi: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Ines Silva: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Bilal Milbes: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Noah Kojima: Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.Victoria Hess: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Maria Shacreaw: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Lauren Lopez: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Matthew Brobeck: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Fred Turner: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Lee Spraggon: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Takako Tabata: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Melanie Ott: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.Jennifer A Doudna: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; HHMI, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.",,,,10.1101/2021.12.20.21268048,,,0,

Current treatment strategies focus on mTOR inhibition with rapamycin and its derivatives. While effective at improving some aspects of TSC, chronic rapamycin inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and is associated with systemic side-effects. It is currently unknown which mTOR complex is most relevant for TSC-related brain phenotypes. Here we used genetic strategies to selectively reduce neuronal mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity in mouse models of TSC. We find that reduction of the mTORC1 component Raptor, but not the mTORC2 component Rictor, rebalanced mTOR signaling in Tsc1 knock-out neurons.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",,,,,,2022/8/16/6/0,2022/08/15,2022/8/16/6/0,Takayoshi Shirasaki ;

We conducted a population size-weighted, one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of health insurance coverage, using a population-based sample of 2,035,401 participants ages 15-59 from nationally representative household surveys in fifty-six countries during the period 2006-18. One in five people (20.3 percent) across the fifty-six countries in our study had health insurance. Health insurance coverage exceeded 50 percent in only seven countries and 70 percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4 percent versus 28.6 percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege. Low- and middle-income countries need to massively expand health insurance coverage if they intend to use insurance to achieve universal health coverage.",,,,,,2022/8/2/6/0,,2022/8/2/6/0,Simiao Chen ; Pascal Geldsetzer ; Qiushi Chen ; Mosa Moshabela ; Lirui Jiao ; Osondu Ogbuoji ; Ali Sie ; Rifat Atun ; Till Bärnighausen,,"Ali Sie, Ministry of Health, Nouna, Burkina Faso.;Lirui Jiao, Columbia University, New York, New York.;Mosa Moshabela, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Glenwood, Durban, South Africa; and Africa Health Research Institute, Mtubatuba, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.;Osondu Ogbuoji, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.;Pascal Geldsetzer, Stanford University, Stanford, California; and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California.;Qiushi Chen, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania.;Rifat Atun, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.;Simiao Chen (simiao.chen@uni-heidelberg.de), Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.;Till Bärnighausen, Heidelberg University; Africa Health Research Institute; and Harvard University.","Simiao Chen: Simiao Chen (simiao.chen@uni-heidelberg.de), Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Pascal Geldsetzer: Pascal Geldsetzer, Stanford University, Stanford, California; and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California.Qiushi Chen: Qiushi Chen, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania.Mosa Moshabela: Mosa Moshabela, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Glenwood, Durban, South Africa; and Africa Health Research Institute, Mtubatuba, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Lirui Jiao: Lirui Jiao, Columbia University, New York, New York.Osondu Ogbuoji: Osondu Ogbuoji, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.Ali Sie: Ali Sie, Ministry of Health, Nouna, Burkina Faso.Rifat Atun: Rifat Atun, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.Till Bärnighausen: Till Bärnighausen, Heidelberg University; Africa Health Research Institute; and Harvard University.",,,,,,,0,

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection. These data demonstrate the functionality of ACE2-OE organoids in SARS-CoV-2 research and identify an incomplete NF-κB feedback loop as a rheostat of viral infection that may promote inflammation and severe disease.",,,,,,2022/8/20/6/0,2022/08/02,2022/8/20/6/0,Camille R Simoneau ;

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene in Culex mosquitoes are associated with knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. RNAseq was used to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. The cDNA sequences were used to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F kdr mutation in the Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay was used successfully in six Culex spp. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. The L1014F kdr mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and was more prevalent in mosquitoes collected near farmland. The Culex RTkdr assay takes advantage of the RNA that vector control agencies routinely isolate to assess arbovirus prevalence in mosquitoes. We anticipate that public health and vector control agencies may employ the Culex RTkdr assay to define the geographic distribution of the L1014F kdr mutation in Culex species and improve the monitoring of insecticide resistance that will ultimately contribute to effective control of Culex mosquitoes.",,,,,,2022/8/9/6/0,2022/08/08,2022/8/9/6/0,Kelli M Hager ; Erick Gaona ; Amy Kistler ; Kalani Ratnasiri ; Hanna Retallack ; Miguel Barretto ; Sarah S Wheeler ; Christopher M Hoover ; Eric J Haas-Stapleton,,"Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.;Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.;Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.;Sacramento-Yolo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, CA, United States of America.;School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.;University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.","Kelli M Hager: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.Erick Gaona: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.Amy Kistler: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.Kalani Ratnasiri: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.Hanna Retallack: University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.Miguel Barretto: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.Sarah S Wheeler: Sacramento-Yolo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, CA, United States of America.Christopher M Hoover: School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.Eric J Haas-Stapleton: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.",,,,,,,0,"Greenleaf, Will; Marson, Alex"

THP is a precursor in the production of the drugs atracurium and cisatracurium, and papaverine is used as an antispasmodic during vascular surgery. In recent years, metabolic engineering advances have enabled the production of natural products through heterologous expression of pathway enzymes in yeast. Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products. Biosynthesis of THP and papaverine has not been achieved to date, in part because multiple pathway enzymes have not been elucidated. Here, we describe the development of an engineered yeast strain for de novo biosynthesis of THP. The production of THP is achieved through heterologous expression of two enzyme variants with activity on nonnative substrates. Through protein engineering, we developed a variant of ",metabolic engineering ; papaverine ; plant natural products ; protein engineering ; tetrahydropapaverine,,,,,2022/8/9/6/0,2022/08/08,2022/8/9/6/0,Osman K Jamil ; Aaron Cravens ; James T Payne ; Colin Y Kim ; Christina D Smolke,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.;Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.;Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.","Osman K Jamil: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Aaron Cravens: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.James T Payne: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Colin Y Kim: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Christina D Smolke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.",,,,,,,0,"Olzmann, James"

Each entry in the database reports a quantitative value (or a time series of values) along with clear referencing of the primary source, the method of measurement or estimation, an assessment of uncertainty, and links to the underlying data, as well as a permanent identifier called a Human Impacts ID (HuID). While there are other databases that house some of these values, they are typically focused on a single topic area, like energy usage or greenhouse gas emissions. The Human Impacts Database facilitates access to carefully curated data, acting as a quantitative resource pertaining to the myriad ways in which humans have an impact on the Earth, for practicing scientists, the general public, and those involved in education for sustainable development alike. We outline the structure of the database, describe our curation procedures, and use this database to generate a graphical summary of the current state of human impacts on the Earth, illustrating both their numerical values and their intimate interconnections.","Anthropocene ; climate change, Earth-human system, global ecology ; database ; human impacts",,,,,2022/9/21/6/0,2022/08/03,2022/9/21/6/0,Griffin Chure ; Rachel A Banks ; Avi I Flamholz ; Nicholas S Sarai ; Mason Kamb ; Ignacio Lopez-Gomez ; Yinon Bar-On ; Ron Milo ; Rob Phillips,,"Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.;Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.;Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.;Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Resnick Sustainibility Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.;Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Resnick Sustainibility Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.;Resnick Sustainibility Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.","Griffin Chure: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.Rachel A Banks: Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Resnick Sustainibility Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Avi I Flamholz: Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Resnick Sustainibility Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.Nicholas S Sarai: Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.Mason Kamb: Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Ignacio Lopez-Gomez: Resnick Sustainibility Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.Yinon Bar-On: Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.Ron Milo: Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.Rob Phillips: Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.",,,,10.1101/2022.03.04.483053,,,0,"Quake, Steve"
