However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, this work provides a simplified purification scheme for ferritin-based vaccines.",,,,,,2022-08-13,2022/08/12,2022/8/13,Payton Weidenbacher; Sriharshita Musunuri; Abigail E Powell; Shaogeng Tang; Jonathan Do; Mrinmoy Sanyal; Peter S Kim,,"Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.","Payton Weidenbacher: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Sriharshita Musunuri: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Abigail E Powell: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Shaogeng Tang: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Jonathan Do: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Mrinmoy Sanyal: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Peter S Kim: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

The discovery of conserved genes in viruses infecting geographically and phylogenetically diverse hosts has provided important evolutionary context for human and animal pathogens. However, the resulting viral genomes are often incomplete, and analyses largely characterize the distribution of viruses over their dynamics. Here, we show how the accumulated data of metagenomic studies can be integrated to reveal geographic and evolutionary dynamics in a case study of Orthomyxoviridae, the family of RNA viruses containing influenza virus. First, we use sequences of the orthomyxovirid W[u]han mosquito virus 6 to track the global migrations of its host. We then look at overall orthomyxovirus genome evolution, finding significant gene gain and loss across members of the family, especially in the surface proteins responsible for cell and host tropism. We find that the surface protein of W[u]han mosquito virus 6 exhibits accelerated non-synonymous evolution suggestive of antigenic evolution, and an entire quaranjavirid group bearing highly diverged surface proteins. Finally we quantify the progress of orthomyxovirus discovery and forecast that many highly diverged Orthomyxoviridae members remain to be found. We argue that continued metagenomic studies will be fruitful for understanding the dynamics, evolution, ecology of viruses and their hosts, regardless of whether novel viruses are actually identified or not, as long as study designs allowing for the resolution of complete viral genomes are employed.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.31.505987,3,new results,2023-01-16,01/16/2023,,Gytis Dudas; Joshua Batson,"Dudas, G.; Batson, J.","Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub","Gytis Dudas, Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University], [Joshua Batson, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",NA,,,,,0

Microsporidia use an unusual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 1/sec. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations.

We analyzed data from 93 ARDS patients with sepsis enrolled in a multi-center prospective cohort of critically ill patients, comparing 970 metabolites between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. 188 metabolites were differentially abundant between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. After adjusting for age, sex, confounding medications, and comorbid liver and kidney disease, 82 metabolites remained significantly different. Hyperinflammatory ARDS patients had reduced circulating lipids but high levels of pyruvate, lactate, and malate. Metabolic cluster and LCA-derived phenotypes were each significantly and independently associated with survival.

Adaptation to a genetically homogeneous host population should theoretically result in specialization, while adaptation to an evolving host population (i.e., coevolution) can result in various outcomes including diversification, range expansion, and/or local adaptation. For viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages), our understanding of how evolutionary history of the bacterial host(s) impacts viral genotypic and phenotypic evolution is currently limited. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and two different metrics of phage impacts to compare the genotypes and phenotypes of lytic phages that had either coevolved with or were repeatedly passaged on an unchanging (ancestral) strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Genomes of coevolved phages had more mutations than those of phages passaged on a constant host, and most mutations were in genes encoding phage tail-associated proteins. Phages from both passaging treatments shared some phenotypic outcomes, including range expansion and divergence across replicate populations, but coevolved phages were more efficient at reducing population growth (particularly of sympatric coevolved hosts). Genotypic similarity correlated with infectivity profile similarity in coevolved phages, but not in phages passaged on the ancestral host. Overall, while adaptation to either host type (coevolving or ancestral) led to divergence in phage tail proteins and infectivity patterns, coevolution led to more rapid molecular changes that increased bacterial killing efficiency and had more predictable effects on infectivity range.

However, current translational studies have limited real world evidence as cancer outcomes are dispersed across veterinary clinics and genomic tests are rarely performed on dogs. In this study, we aim to expand the value of canine models by systematically characterizing genetic mutations in tumors and their response to targeted treatments. In total, we collect and analyze survival outcomes for 2119 tumor-bearing dogs and the prognostic effect of genomic alterations in a subset of 1108 dogs. Our analysis identifies prognostic concordance between canines and humans in several key oncogenes, including TP53 and PIK3CA. We also find that several targeted treatments designed for humans are associated with a positive prognosis when used to treat canine tumors with specific genomic alterations, underscoring the value of canine models in advancing drug discovery for personalized oncology.",,,,,,2023-01-20,2023/01/19,2023/1/20,Kevin Wu; Lucas Rodrigues; Gerald Post; Garrett Harvey; Michelle White; Aubrey Miller; Lindsay Lambert; Benjamin Lewis; Christina Lopes; James Zou,,"One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.; One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US. lucas@fidocure.com.; One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, US.","Kevin Wu: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, US.Lucas Rodrigues: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US. lucas@fidocure.com.Gerald Post: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.Garrett Harvey: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.Michelle White: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.Aubrey Miller: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.Lindsay Lambert: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.Benjamin Lewis: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.Christina Lopes: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.James Zou: One Health Company, Palo Alto, CA, US.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, US.",,,,,,0
