However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, this work provides a simplified purification scheme for ferritin-based vaccines.",,,,,,2022-08-13,2022/08/12,2022/8/13,Payton Weidenbacher; Sriharshita Musunuri; Abigail E Powell; Shaogeng Tang; Jonathan Do; Mrinmoy Sanyal; Peter S Kim,,"Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.","Payton Weidenbacher: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Sriharshita Musunuri: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Abigail E Powell: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Shaogeng Tang: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Jonathan Do: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Mrinmoy Sanyal: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Peter S Kim: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

Here, we use thousands of microbial communities cultured in vitro from human feces to uncover simple assembly rules and develop a predictive model of community composition upon addition of single nutrients from central carbon metabolism to a complex medium. Community membership was largely determined by the donor feces, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient, due to the ability of fast-growing organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities. Our study reveals that community assembly follows simple rules of nutrient utilization dynamics and provides a predictive framework for manipulating gut commensal communities through nutritional perturbations.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.13.523996,1,new results,2023-01-14,01/14/2023,,Andrés Aranda-Díaz; Lisa Willis; Taylor H.

Microsporidia use an unusual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 1/sec. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations.

Adaptation to a genetically homogeneous host population should theoretically result in specialization, while adaptation to an evolving host population (i.e., coevolution) can result in various outcomes including diversification, range expansion, and/or local adaptation. For viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages), our understanding of how evolutionary history of the bacterial host(s) impacts viral genotypic and phenotypic evolution is currently limited. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and two different metrics of phage impacts to compare the genotypes and phenotypes of lytic phages that had either coevolved with or were repeatedly passaged on an unchanging (ancestral) strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Genomes of coevolved phages had more mutations than those of phages passaged on a constant host, and most mutations were in genes encoding phage tail-associated proteins. Phages from both passaging treatments shared some phenotypic outcomes, including range expansion and divergence across replicate populations, but coevolved phages were more efficient at reducing population growth (particularly of sympatric coevolved hosts). Genotypic similarity correlated with infectivity profile similarity in coevolved phages, but not in phages passaged on the ancestral host. Overall, while adaptation to either host type (coevolving or ancestral) led to divergence in phage tail proteins and infectivity patterns, coevolution led to more rapid molecular changes that increased bacterial killing efficiency and had more predictable effects on infectivity range.
