By comparing transcriptomes of spinal cord and brain ependymal cells, which lack stem cell abilities, we identify immature cells as potential spinal cord stem cells. Following spinal cord injury, these cells re-enter the cell cycle, which is accompanied by a short-lived reversal of ependymal cell maturation.

However, like other optical microscopy tools, a high numerical aperture (N.A.) lens is required to generate a tight focus, generating a narrow depth of field, which necessitates dynamic focusing and limiting the imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a metasurface platform that generates multiple axial foci, which multiplies the volumetric OCT imaging speed by offering several focal planes. This platform offers accurate and flexible control over the number, positions, and intensities of axial foci generated. All-glass metasurface optical elements 8 mm in diameter are fabricated from fused-silica wafers and implemented into our scanning OCT system. With a constant lateral resolution of 1.1 μm over all depths, the multifocal OCT triples the volumetric acquisition speed for dermatological imaging, while still clearly revealing features of stratum corneum, epidermal cells, and dermal-epidermal junctions and offering morphological information as diagnostic criteria for basal cell carcinoma. The imaging speed can be further improved in a sparse sample, e.g., 7-fold with a seven-foci beam. In summary, this work demonstrates the concept of metasurface-based multifocal OCT for rapid virtual biopsy, further providing insights for developing rapid volumetric imaging systems with high resolution and compact volume.",all-glass metasurface; cellular resolution; multifocal beam; noninvasive imaging; optical coherence tomography; phase change materials; virtual biopsy,,,,,2023-02-07,2023/02/06,2023/2/7,Jingjing Zhao; Aidan Van Vleck; Yonatan Winetraub; Lin Du; Yong Han; Sumaira Aasi; Kavita Yang Sarin; Adam de la Zerda,,"Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.; Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.","Jingjing Zhao: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Aidan Van Vleck: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Yonatan Winetraub: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Lin Du: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.Yong Han: Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.Sumaira Aasi: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kavita Yang Sarin: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Adam de la Zerda: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Unfortunately, contemporary molecular detection methods are generally limited to a dynamic range of sensitivity spanning just 3-4 orders of magnitude, whereas the actual physiological dynamic range of the human plasma proteome spans more than 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely on sample splitting and differential dilution to compensate for this mismatch, but such measures greatly limit the reproducibility and scalability that can be achieved. In particular, the effects of non-linear dilution can greatly confound the analysis of multiplexed assays. We describe here a two-pronged strategy for equalizing the signal generated by each analyte in a multiplexed panel, thereby enabling simultaneous quantification of targets spanning a wide range of concentrations. We apply our 'EVROS' strategy to a proximity ligation assay and demonstrate simultaneous quantification of four analytes present at concentrations spanning from low femtomolar to mid-nanomolar levels. In this initial demonstration, we achieve a dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude in a single 5 l sample of undiluted human serum, highlighting the opportunity to achieve sensitive, accurate detection of diverse analytes in a highly multiplexed fashion.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.07.527534,1,new results,2023-02-08,02/08/2023,,Sharon S Newman; Brandon Wilson; Daniel Mamerow; Benjamin Wollant; Hnin Nyein; Yael Rosenberg-Hasson; Holden Maecker; Michael Eisenstein; Hyongsok Tom Soh,"Newman, S.

Two proximity labeling (PL) enzymes, TurboID and APEX, are targeted to source and destination compartments, and PL with each enzyme is performed in tandem via sequential addition of their small-molecule substrates. Mass spectrometry identifies the proteins tagged by both enzymes. Using TransitID, we mapped proteome trafficking between cytosol and mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus, and nucleolus and stress granules, uncovering a role for stress granules in protecting the transcription factor JUN from oxidative stress.

Beyond myeloid cells, in natural infection, B cells harbor replicating DENV capable of infecting permissive cells. Alterations in cell type abundance, gene and protein expression and secretion, and cell-cell communications point towards increased migration and inflammation in SD progressors (SDp). Concurrently, antigen presenting cells from SDp demonstrate intact uptake, yet impaired interferon responses and antigen presentation, in part DENV-modulated.

In critically ill patients, anti-cytokine antibodies were far more common in infected versus uninfected patients. In cell-based functional assays, 11 of 39 samples positive for select anti-cytokine antibodies displayed receptor blocking activity against surface receptors for Type I IFN, GM-CSF, and IL-6.

The underlying pathophysiology of Long COVID remains unknown. Given that autoantibodies have been found to play a role in severity of COVID infection and certain other post-COVID sequelae, their potential role in Long COVID is important to investigate. Here we apply a well-established, unbiased, proteome-wide autoantibody detection technology (PhIP-Seq) to a robustly phenotyped cohort of 121 individuals with Long COVID, 64 individuals with prior COVID-19 who reported full recovery, and 57 pre-COVID controls. While a distinct autoreactive signature was detected which separates individuals with prior COVID infection from those never exposed to COVID, we did not detect patterns of autoreactivity that separate individuals with Long COVID relative to individuals fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data suggest that there are robust alterations in autoreactive antibody profiles due to infection; however, no association of autoreactive antibodies and Long COVID was apparent by this assay.",,,medrxiv;2023.02.06.23285532,2,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2023-02-09,02/09/2023,,Aaron Bodansky; Chung-Yu Wang; Aditi Saxena; Anthea Mitchell; Saki Takahashi; Khamal Anglin; Beatrice Huang; Rebecca Hoh; Scott Lu; Sarah A Goldberg; Justin Romero; Brandon Tran; Raushun Kirtikar; Halle Grebe; Matthew So; Bryan Greenhouse; Matthew S Durstenfeld; Priscilla Y Hsue; Joanna Hellmuth; J Daniel Kelly; Jeffrey N Martin; Mark S Anderson; Steven G Deeks; Timothy J Henrich; Joseph L DeRisi; Michael J Peluso,"Bodansky, A.; Wang, C.-Y.; Saxena, A.; Mitchell, A.; Takahashi, S.; Anglin, K.; Huang, B.; Hoh, R.; Lu, S.; Goldberg, S.

Phosphopeptides presented in complex with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) have been reported to provide a stability advantage over their unmodified counterparts when presented by the common HLA allele A*02:01. This stability in turn is thought to translate to enhanced immunogenicity. Whether tumor-associated phosphopeptides presented by other common alleles exhibit immunogenicity and structural characteristics similar to those presented by A*02:01 is unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine the identity, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides presented by the common alleles HLA-A*03:01, -A*11:01, -C*07:01, and -C*07:02. We isolated peptide-MHC complexes by immunoprecipitation of 10 healthy and neoplastic tissue samples using mass spectrometry, and then combined the resulting data with public immunopeptidomics datasets to assemble a curated set of 2,466 phosphopeptides presented by 20 distinct healthy and neoplastic tissue types. We determined the biochemical features of selected phosphopeptides by in vitro binding assays and in silico docking, and their immunogenicity by analyzing healthy donor T cells for phosphopeptide-specific multimer binding and cytokine production. We demonstrated that HLA-A*03:01 and -A*11:01 present shared phosphopeptides on multiple tumor types, particularly lymphomas and leukemias; a subset of these peptides were not found on healthy tissues. These phosphopeptides generally exhibited similar binding to A*11:01 and similar or worse binding to A*03:01 than their unmodified counterparts. Additionally, we found that HLA-C*07:01 phosphopeptides were generally presented in the absence of their unmodified counterparts, and were dependent on B-pocket interactions that were absent in C*07:02, but such interactions were still permissive to unmodified peptide binding. We found that HLA-A*02:01 and -A*11:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cells could be readily detected in an autologous setting, even when the wildtype peptide was co-presented. In contrast, HLA-A*03:01 or -C*07:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cell responses were not elicited in autologous donors, but could be elicited in allogeneic donors. Our results demonstrated that phosphopeptides across multiple alleles represent shared tumor-specific antigens that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapy, but the immunogenicity of such phosphopeptides is not a general feature, which may be explained by a lack of increase in energetic favorability associated with phosphopeptide binding to A*03:01. Thus, to address an expanded patient population, phosphopeptide-targeted immunotherapies should be wary of allele-specific differences.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.08.527552,2,new results,2023-02-09,02/09/2023,,Zaki Molvi; Martin G.

The precise nature of this attenuation remains unknown as generating replication-competent viral genomes is challenging because of the length of the viral genome (30kb). Here, we designed a plasmid-based viral genome assembly and rescue strategy (pGLUE) that constructs complete infectious viruses or noninfectious subgenomic replicons in a single ligation reaction with >80% efficiency. Fully sequenced replicons and infectious viral stocks can be generated in 1 and 3 weeks, respectively. By testing a series of naturally occurring viruses as well as Delta-Omicron chimeric replicons, we show that Omicron nonstructural protein 6 harbors critical attenuating mutations, which dampen viral RNA replication and reduce lipid droplet consumption. Thus, pGLUE overcomes remaining barriers to broadly study SARS-CoV-2 replication and reveals deficits in nonstructural protein function underlying Omicron attenuation.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.31.525914,1,new results,2023-02-09,02/09/2023,,Taha Y Taha; Irene P Chen; Jennifer M Hayashi; Takako Tabata; Keith Walcott; Gabriella R Kimmerly; Abdullah M Syed; Alison Ciling; Rahul K Suryawanshi; Hannah S Martin; Bryan H Bach; Chia-Lin Tsou; Mauricio Montano; Mir M Khalid; Bharath K Sreekumar; G.

University of California, Berkeley.",bioRxiv,10.1101/2023.02.09.527927,,Unified bursting strategies in ectopic and endogenous even-skipped expression patterns,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.09.527927v1,"Transcription often occurs in bursts as gene promoters switch stochastically between active and inactive states. Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, despite responding to different transcription factors, all even-skipped enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their trans-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic even-skipped transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic even-skipped expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping even-skipped bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.09.527927,1,new results,2023-02-10,02/10/2023,,Augusto Berrocal; Nicholas C Lammers; Hernan G Garcia; Michael B Eisen,"Berrocal, A.; Lammers, N.

BioTranslator takes a user-written textual description of a new concept and then translates this description to a non-text biological data instance. The key idea of BioTranslator is to develop a multilingual translation framework, where multiple modalities of biological data are all translated to text. We demonstrate how BioTranslator enables the identification of novel cell types using only a textual description and how BioTranslator can be further generalized to protein function prediction and drug target identification.
