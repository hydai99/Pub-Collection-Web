Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Escherichia coli (Eco) with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis. Together, our study highlights the consequences of co-regulating essential pathways on recipient fitness during interbacterial competition, and how antibacterial toxins leverage cellular vulnerabilities that are both direct and indirect to their specific targets in vivo.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.20.524922,2,new results,2023-01-23,01/23/2023,,Kristine L Trotta; Beth M Hayes; Johannes P Schneider; Jing Wang; Horia Todor; Patrick Rockefeller Grimes; Ziyi Zhao; William L Hatleberg; Melanie R Silvis; Rachel Kim; Byoung Mo Koo; Marek Basler; Seemay Chou,"Trotta, K.

Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the ""proton wire"" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.25.525534,1,new results,2023-01-26,01/26/2023,,Chandrima Majumdar; Joshua A.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote tumorigenesis and development. Bufalin is the main active monomer of the clinical drug cinobufacini, which exhibits antitumor activity in various cancers. But few research have investigated the effect of bufalin in inhibiting metastasis from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment. We first isolated CAFs from freshly resected colorectal cancer patient specimens and observed the effect of CAFs on CRC cell invasion through a series of experiments. We explored the effect of bufalin on the physiological activity of CRC mediated by CAFs through experiments. In our study, we found that CAFs could promote CRC cell activity through the STAT3 pathway. Bufalin reversed CAF-mediated CRC invasion and metastasis by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway.
