Ependymal cells are, however, heterogeneous, and the biological diversity this represents and how it changes with age remain unknown. Here, we present a single-cell transcriptomic census of spinal cord ependymal cells from adult and aged mice, identifying not only all known ependymal cell subtypes but also immature as well as mature cell states. By comparing transcriptomes of spinal cord and brain ependymal cells, which lack stem cell abilities, we identify immature cells as potential spinal cord stem cells. Following spinal cord injury, these cells re-enter the cell cycle, which is accompanied by a short-lived reversal of ependymal cell maturation. We further analyze ependymal cells in the human spinal cord and identify widespread cell maturation and altered cell identities.

The origins of tissue specificity in these diseases are unclear, as the A-type Lamins are abundant and broadly expressed proteins. We show that A-type Lamin protein and transcript levels are uncorrelated across tissues. As protein-transcript discordance can be caused by variations in protein lifetime, we applied quantitative proteomics to profile protein turnover rates in healthy and progeroid tissues. We discover that tissue context and disease mutation each influence A-type Lamin protein lifetime. Lamin A/C has a weeks-long lifetime in the aorta, heart, and fat, but a days-long lifetime in tissues spared from disease. Progerin is even more long-lived than Lamin A/C in the cardiovascular system and accumulates there over time. These proteins are insoluble and densely bundled in cardiovascular tissues, which may present an energetic barrier to degradation. We reveal that human disease alleles are significantly over-represented in the long-lived proteome. These findings indicate that gene therapy interventions will have significant latency and limited potency in disrupting long-lived disease-linked proteins such as Progerin.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.04.527139,1,new results,2023-02-04,02/04/2023,,John Hasper; Kevin Welle; Kyle Swovick; Jennifer Hryhorenko; Sina Ghaemmaghami; Abigail Buchwalter,"Hasper, J.; Welle, K.; Swovick, K.; Hryhorenko, J.; Ghaemmaghami, S.; Buchwalter, A.","Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; Department of Biology, University of Rochester; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Department of Physiology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub","John Hasper, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California], [Kevin Welle, University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory], [Kyle Swovick, University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory], [Jennifer Hryhorenko, University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory], [Sina Ghaemmaghami, University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory, Department of Biology, University of Rochester], [Abigail Buchwalter, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, Department of Physiology, University of California, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",NA,,,,,0

Human tumours can evolve therapy resistance by acquiring de novo genetic alterations and increased heterogeneity via mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1. Here, through parallel analysis of human clinical samples, tumour xenograft and cell line models and murine model systems, we uncover an unanticipated mechanism of therapy-induced adaptation that fuels the evolution of drug resistance. Targeted therapy directed against EGFR and ALK oncoproteins in lung cancer induced adaptations favoring apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)-mediated genome mutagenesis. In human oncogenic EGFR-driven and ALK-driven lung cancers and preclinical models, EGFR or ALK inhibitor treatment induced the expression and DNA mutagenic activity of APOBEC3B via therapy-mediated activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Moreover, targeted therapy also mediated downregulation of certain DNA repair enzymes such as UNG2, which normally counteracts APOBEC-catalyzed DNA deamination events. In mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer mouse models, APOBEC3B was detrimental to tumour initiation and yet advantageous to tumour progression during EGFR targeted therapy, consistent with TRACERx data demonstrating subclonal enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. This study reveals how cancers adapt and drive genetic diversity in response to targeted therapy and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable clinical benefit to targeted cancer therapy.",,,biorxiv;2020.12.18.423280,4,confirmatory results,2023-02-05,02/05/2023,,Manasi K.

Since echinoderms are defined by morphological novelty, even the most basic axial comparisons with their bilaterian relatives are problematic. Here, we used conserved antero-posterior (AP) axial molecular markers to determine whether the highly derived adult body plan of echinoderms masks underlying patterning similarities with other deuterostomes. To revisit this classical question, we used RNA tomography and in situ hybridizations in the sea star Patiria miniata to investigate the expression of a suite of conserved transcription factors with well-established roles in the establishment of AP polarity in bilaterians. We find that the relative spatial expression of these markers in P. miniata ambulacral ectoderm shows similarity with other deuterostomes, with the midline of each ray representing the most anterior territory and the most lateral parts exhibiting a more posterior identity. Interestingly, there is no ectodermal territory in the sea star that expresses the characteristic bilaterian trunk genetic patterning program. This suggests that from the perspective of ectoderm patterning, echinoderms are mostly head-like animals, and prompts a reinterpretation of the evolutionary trends that made echinoderms the most derived animal group.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.05.527185,1,new results,2023-02-05,02/05/2023,,L.

However, like other optical microscopy tools, a high numerical aperture (N.A.) lens is required to generate a tight focus, generating a narrow depth of field, which necessitates dynamic focusing and limiting the imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a metasurface platform that generates multiple axial foci, which multiplies the volumetric OCT imaging speed by offering several focal planes. This platform offers accurate and flexible control over the number, positions, and intensities of axial foci generated. All-glass metasurface optical elements 8 mm in diameter are fabricated from fused-silica wafers and implemented into our scanning OCT system. With a constant lateral resolution of 1.1 μm over all depths, the multifocal OCT triples the volumetric acquisition speed for dermatological imaging, while still clearly revealing features of stratum corneum, epidermal cells, and dermal-epidermal junctions and offering morphological information as diagnostic criteria for basal cell carcinoma. The imaging speed can be further improved in a sparse sample, e.g., 7-fold with a seven-foci beam. In summary, this work demonstrates the concept of metasurface-based multifocal OCT for rapid virtual biopsy, further providing insights for developing rapid volumetric imaging systems with high resolution and compact volume.",all-glass metasurface; cellular resolution; multifocal beam; noninvasive imaging; optical coherence tomography; phase change materials; virtual biopsy,,,,,2023-02-07,2023/02/06,2023/2/7,Jingjing Zhao; Aidan Van Vleck; Yonatan Winetraub; Lin Du; Yong Han; Sumaira Aasi; Kavita Yang Sarin; Adam de la Zerda,,"Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.; Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.","Jingjing Zhao: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Aidan Van Vleck: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Yonatan Winetraub: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Lin Du: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.Yong Han: Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.Sumaira Aasi: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kavita Yang Sarin: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Adam de la Zerda: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Unfortunately, contemporary molecular detection methods are generally limited to a dynamic range of sensitivity spanning just 3-4 orders of magnitude, whereas the actual physiological dynamic range of the human plasma proteome spans more than 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely on sample splitting and differential dilution to compensate for this mismatch, but such measures greatly limit the reproducibility and scalability that can be achieved. In particular, the effects of non-linear dilution can greatly confound the analysis of multiplexed assays. We describe here a two-pronged strategy for equalizing the signal generated by each analyte in a multiplexed panel, thereby enabling simultaneous quantification of targets spanning a wide range of concentrations. We apply our 'EVROS' strategy to a proximity ligation assay and demonstrate simultaneous quantification of four analytes present at concentrations spanning from low femtomolar to mid-nanomolar levels. In this initial demonstration, we achieve a dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude in a single 5 l sample of undiluted human serum, highlighting the opportunity to achieve sensitive, accurate detection of diverse analytes in a highly multiplexed fashion.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.07.527534,1,new results,2023-02-08,02/08/2023,,Sharon S Newman; Brandon Wilson; Daniel Mamerow; Benjamin Wollant; Hnin Nyein; Yael Rosenberg-Hasson; Holden Maecker; Michael Eisenstein; Hyongsok Tom Soh,"Newman, S.

To define DENV target cells and immunological hallmarks of SD progression in children's blood, we integrated virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq 2 (viscRNA-Seq 2) with functional assays. Beyond myeloid cells, in natural infection, B cells harbor replicating DENV capable of infecting permissive cells. Alterations in cell type abundance, gene and protein expression and secretion, and cell-cell communications point towards increased migration and inflammation in SD progressors (SDp). Concurrently, antigen presenting cells from SDp demonstrate intact uptake, yet impaired interferon responses and antigen presentation, in part DENV-modulated. Increased activation, regulation, and exhaustion of effector responses and expansion of HLA-DR-expressing, possibly compensatory, adaptive-like NK cells also characterize SDp. These findings reveal DENV target cells in the human blood and provide insight into SD pathogenesis beyond antibody-mediated enhancement.",,,biorxiv;2022.12.11.519930,2,new results,2023-02-08,02/08/2023,,Luca Ghita; Zhiyuan Yao; Yike Xie; Veronica Duran; Busra Halise Cagirici; Jerome Samir; Ilham Osman; Olga Lucia Agudelo; Ana Maria Sanz; Malaya K.

The underlying pathophysiology of Long COVID remains unknown. Given that autoantibodies have been found to play a role in severity of COVID infection and certain other post-COVID sequelae, their potential role in Long COVID is important to investigate. Here we apply a well-established, unbiased, proteome-wide autoantibody detection technology (PhIP-Seq) to a robustly phenotyped cohort of 121 individuals with Long COVID, 64 individuals with prior COVID-19 who reported full recovery, and 57 pre-COVID controls. While a distinct autoreactive signature was detected which separates individuals with prior COVID infection from those never exposed to COVID, we did not detect patterns of autoreactivity that separate individuals with Long COVID relative to individuals fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data suggest that there are robust alterations in autoreactive antibody profiles due to infection; however, no association of autoreactive antibodies and Long COVID was apparent by this assay.",,,medrxiv;2023.02.06.23285532,2,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2023-02-09,02/09/2023,,Aaron Bodansky; Chung-Yu Wang; Aditi Saxena; Anthea Mitchell; Saki Takahashi; Khamal Anglin; Beatrice Huang; Rebecca Hoh; Scott Lu; Sarah A Goldberg; Justin Romero; Brandon Tran; Raushun Kirtikar; Halle Grebe; Matthew So; Bryan Greenhouse; Matthew S Durstenfeld; Priscilla Y Hsue; Joanna Hellmuth; J Daniel Kelly; Jeffrey N Martin; Mark S Anderson; Steven G Deeks; Timothy J Henrich; Joseph L DeRisi; Michael J Peluso,"Bodansky, A.; Wang, C.-Y.; Saxena, A.; Mitchell, A.; Takahashi, S.; Anglin, K.; Huang, B.; Hoh, R.; Lu, S.; Goldberg, S.

Phosphopeptides presented in complex with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) have been reported to provide a stability advantage over their unmodified counterparts when presented by the common HLA allele A*02:01. This stability in turn is thought to translate to enhanced immunogenicity. Whether tumor-associated phosphopeptides presented by other common alleles exhibit immunogenicity and structural characteristics similar to those presented by A*02:01 is unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine the identity, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides presented by the common alleles HLA-A*03:01, -A*11:01, -C*07:01, and -C*07:02. We isolated peptide-MHC complexes by immunoprecipitation of 10 healthy and neoplastic tissue samples using mass spectrometry, and then combined the resulting data with public immunopeptidomics datasets to assemble a curated set of 2,466 phosphopeptides presented by 20 distinct healthy and neoplastic tissue types. We determined the biochemical features of selected phosphopeptides by in vitro binding assays and in silico docking, and their immunogenicity by analyzing healthy donor T cells for phosphopeptide-specific multimer binding and cytokine production. We demonstrated that HLA-A*03:01 and -A*11:01 present shared phosphopeptides on multiple tumor types, particularly lymphomas and leukemias; a subset of these peptides were not found on healthy tissues. These phosphopeptides generally exhibited similar binding to A*11:01 and similar or worse binding to A*03:01 than their unmodified counterparts. Additionally, we found that HLA-C*07:01 phosphopeptides were generally presented in the absence of their unmodified counterparts, and were dependent on B-pocket interactions that were absent in C*07:02, but such interactions were still permissive to unmodified peptide binding. We found that HLA-A*02:01 and -A*11:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cells could be readily detected in an autologous setting, even when the wildtype peptide was co-presented. In contrast, HLA-A*03:01 or -C*07:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cell responses were not elicited in autologous donors, but could be elicited in allogeneic donors. Our results demonstrated that phosphopeptides across multiple alleles represent shared tumor-specific antigens that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapy, but the immunogenicity of such phosphopeptides is not a general feature, which may be explained by a lack of increase in energetic favorability associated with phosphopeptide binding to A*03:01. Thus, to address an expanded patient population, phosphopeptide-targeted immunotherapies should be wary of allele-specific differences.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.08.527552,2,new results,2023-02-09,02/09/2023,,Zaki Molvi; Martin G.

We profiled IgG autoantibodies in 267 patients from 5 independent cohorts with non-SARS-CoV-2 viral, bacterial, and noninfectious critical illness. Serum samples were screened using Luminex arrays that included 58 cytokines and 55 autoantigens, many of which are associated with connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Samples positive for anti-cytokine antibodies were tested for receptor blocking activity using cell-based functional assays. Anti-cytokine antibodies were identified in > 50% of patients across all 5 acutely ill cohorts. In critically ill patients, anti-cytokine antibodies were far more common in infected versus uninfected patients. In cell-based functional assays, 11 of 39 samples positive for select anti-cytokine antibodies displayed receptor blocking activity against surface receptors for Type I IFN, GM-CSF, and IL-6. Autoantibodies against CTD-associated autoantigens were also commonly observed, including newly detected antibodies that emerged in longitudinal samples. These findings demonstrate that anti-cytokine and autoantibodies are common across different viral and nonviral infections and range in severity of illness.",Adaptive immunity; Autoimmunity; Bacterial infections; Infectious disease; Influenza,,,,,2023-02-09,2023/02/08,2023/2/9,Allan Feng; Emily Y Yang; Andrew Reese Moore; Shaurya Dhingra; Sarah Esther Chang; Xihui Yin; Ruoxi Pi; Elisabeth Km Mack; Sara Völkel; Reinhard Geßner; Margrit Gündisch; Andreas Neubauer; Harald Renz; Sotirios Tsiodras; Paraskevi C Fragkou; Adijat A Asuni; Joseph E Levitt; Jennifer G Wilson; Michelle Leong; Jennifer H Lumb; Rong Mao; Kassandra Pinedo; Jonasel Roque; Christopher M Richards; Mikayla Stabile; Gayathri Swaminathan; Maria L Salagianni; Vasiliki Triantafyllia; Wilhelm Bertrams; Catherine A Blish; Jan E Carette; Jennifer Frankovich; Eric Meffre; Kari Christine Nadeau; Upinder Singh; Taia T Wang; Eline T Luning Prak; Susanne Herold; Evangelos Andreakos; Bernd Schmeck; Chrysanthi Skevaki; Angela J Rogers; Paul J Utz,,"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece.; 4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Attikon University Hospital, Athens, Greece.; European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), Study Group for Respiratory Viruses (ESGREV), Basel, Switzerland.; Department of Emergency Medicine and.; Department of Hematology, Oncology, Immunology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.; Department of Immunobiology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine V, Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, UKGM, Justus Liebig University, and Institute for Lung Health (ILH), Giessen, Germany.; DZL and UGMLC, Giessen, Germany.; Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology.; Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, and.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy, Immunology, Rheumatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection.; Department of Medicine, Sean N.
