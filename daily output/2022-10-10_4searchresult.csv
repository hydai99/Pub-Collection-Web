We quantified how viruses and their hosts respond to the first rainfall of the year in seasonally dry soils - a moment commonly referred to as ""wet-up"", when resident soil microbes are both resuscitated and lysed, with a disproportionately large effect on annual carbon turnover. We applied time-resolved metagenomics, viromics, and quantitative stable isotope probing to track spatiotemporal virus-host trends, and quantify cell death (and by proxy, the amount of biomass carbon released). Dry soil is a sparse yet diverse reservoir of putative virions, of which only a subset thrives following wet-up. A massive degradation of distinct viruses occurs within 24h post wet-up, but after one-week, viral biomass increased by up to seven-fold. Thriving viruses were not induced temperate phages. Our measures of viral-mediated microbial host death indicate that viruses drive a consistent rate of cell lysis after wet-up. These calculations - the first to demonstrate the quantitative impact of viral effects on soil microbiomes and carbon cycling - evidence that viruses significantly impact microbial community assembly. However, viruses do not appear to serve as top-down controls on soil microbial communities following wet-up.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.30.510406,1,new results,01/01/2022,01/01/2022,,Alexa M.

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces an intrinsically different data type than scRNA-seq and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas as well as from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results. We conclude that compared to scRNA-seq, MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for measuring single-cell gene expression and can robustly identify cell types without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq reference atlases.",,,biorxiv;2022.03.04.483068,3,new results,01/01/2022,01/01/2022,,Jonathan Liu; Vanessa Tran; Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri; Ashley Byrne; Michael Borja; Yang Joon Kim; Snigdha Agarwal; Ruofan Wang; Kyle Awayan; Abhishek Murti; Aris Taychameekiatchai; Bruce Wang; George Emanuel; Jiang He; John Haliburton; Angela Oliveira Pisco; Norma Neff,"Liu, J.; Tran, V.; Vemuri, V.

Here, we build on classical ecological models of resource competition to investigate community responses to antibiotic-induced species-specific death rates. Our analyses highlight the complex dependence of species coexistence that can arise from the interplay of resource competition and antibiotic activity, independent of other biological mechanisms. We show that resource competition can cause richness to change non-monotonically as antibiotic concentrations are increased. We identified resource competition structures that cause richness to depend on the order of sequential application of antibiotics (non-transitivity), and the emergence of synergistic and antagonistic effects under simultaneous application of multiple antibiotics (non-additivity). These complex behaviors can be prevalent, especially when generalist consumers are targeted. Communities can be prone to either synergism or antagonism, but typically not both, and antagonism is more common. Furthermore, we identify a striking overlap in competition structures that lead to non-transitivity during antibiotic sequences and those that lead to non-additivity during antibiotic combination, suggesting that our analysis is broadly applicable across a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotic treatment schemes. In sum, our results will facilitate the engineering of community dynamics via deleterious agents.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.01.506215,1,new results,01/04/2022,01/04/2022,,Daniel Philip Newton; Po-Yi Ho; Kerwyn Casey Huang,"Newton, D.

The discovery of conserved genes in viruses infecting geographically and phylogenetically diverse hosts has provided important evolutionary context for human and animal pathogens. However, the resulting viral genomes are often incomplete, and analyses largely characterize the distribution of viruses over their dynamics. Here, we show how the accumulated data of metagenomicstudies can be integrated to reveal geographic and evolutionary dynamics in a case study of Orthomyxoviridae, the family of RNA viruses containing influenza. First, we use sequences of the orthomyxovirus Wuhan mosquito virus 6 to track the global migrations of its host. We then look at overall orthomyxovirus genome evolution, finding significant gene gain and loss across the family, especially in the surface proteins responsible for cell and host tropism. We find that the surface protein of Wuhan mosquito virus 6 exhibits accelerated non-synonymous evolution suggestive of antigenic evolution, and an entire quaranjavirus group bearing highly diverged surface proteins. Finally we quantify the progress of orthomyxovirus discovery and forecast that many highly diverged Orthomyxoviridae remain to be found. We argue that continued metagenomic studies will be fruitful for understanding the dynamics, evolution, ecology of viruses and their hosts, regardless of whether novel species are actually identified or not, as long as study designs allowing for the resolution of complete viral genomes are employed.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.31.505987,2,new results,01/04/2022,01/04/2022,,Gytis Dudas; Joshua Batson,"Dudas, G.; Batson, J.","Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub","[['Gytis Dudas', 'Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University'], ['Joshua Batson', 'Chan Zuckerberg Biohub']]",NA,,,,,0

We hypothesized that metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), which allows for broad genomic-level detection of infectious agents in a biological sample, can systematically identify potential causes of non-malarial fevers.

Methods and FindingsThe 212 participants in this study were of all ages and were enrolled in a longitudinal malaria cohort in eastern Uganda. Between December 2020 and August 2021, respiratory swabs and plasma samples were collected at 313 study visits where participants presented with fever and were negative for malaria by microscopy. Samples were analyzed using CZ ID, a web-based platform for microbial detection in mNGS data. Overall, viral pathogens were detected at 123 of 313 visits (39%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected at 11 visits, from which full viral genomes were recovered from nine. Other prevalent viruses included Influenza A (14 visits), RSV (12 visits), and three of the four strains of seasonal coronaviruses (6 visits). Notably, 11 influenza cases occurred between May and July 2021, coinciding with when the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in this population. The primary limitation of this study is that we were unable to estimate the contribution of bacterial microbes to non-malarial fevers, due to the difficulty of distinguishing bacterial microbes that were pathogenic from those that were commensal or contaminants.

ConclusionsThese results revealed the co-circulation of multiple viral pathogens likely associated with fever in the cohort during this time period. This study illustrates the utility of mNGS in elucidating the multiple causes of non-malarial febrile illness. A better understanding of the pathogen landscape in different settings and age groups could aid in informing diagnostics, case management, and public health surveillance systems.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.02.22279519,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/04/2022,01/04/2022,,Lusajo Mwakibete; Saki Takahashi; Vida Ahyong; Allison Black; John Rek; Isaac Ssewanyana; Moses Kamya; Grant Dorsey; Prasanna Jagannathan; Isabel Rodríguez-Barraquer; Cristina M.

In the airway, basal stem cells differentiate into both multiciliated and secretory cells, which together protect the lungs from inhaled pathogens and particulates. To define how airway stem cells differentiate, we mapped differentiation trajectories using single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identified a transitional intermediate cell state in between basal stem cells and differentiated cells. These intermediate cells induce different gene expression programs that precede differentiation into either multiciliated or secretory cells. For example, we found that within the intermediate cell population, multiciliated cell precursors express Mycl, encoding a MYC-family transcription factor, and secretory cell precursors express Hey1, encoding a transcriptional repressor. We also found that Notch signaling acts on intermediate cells to repress Mycl and induce Hey1. We further show MYCL expression is sufficient to drive multiciliated cell fate, whereas HEY1 expression is sufficient to repress multiciliated cell fate. Using CUT&RUN, we made the surprising observation that MYCL and HEY1 bind to many of the same regulatory elements near genes encoding early regulators of multiciliated cell differentiation. We conclude that intermediate cells receiving Notch signals induce HEY1 to repress the multiciliated cell fate and become secretory cells, while intermediate cells not receiving Notch signals induce MYCL to promote the multiciliated cell fate. These experiments reveal that during airway stem cell differentiation Notch signaling balances the production of two different cell types by regulating the functions of two opposing transcription factors, MYCL and HEY1.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.05.511009,1,new results,01/05/2022,01/05/2022,,Lauren E.

We generated HARs and chimpanzee accelerated regions with the largest alignment of mammalian genomes to date. To facilitate exploration of accelerated evolution in other lineages, we implemented an open-source Nextflow pipeline that runs on any computing platform. Combining deep-learning with chromatin capture experiments in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells, we discovered a significant enrichment of HARs in topologically associating domains (TADs) containing human-specific genomic variants that change three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Differential gene expression between humans and chimpanzees at these loci in multiple cell types suggests rewiring of regulatory interactions between HARs and neurodevelopmental genes. Thus, comparative genomics together with models of 3D genome folding revealed enhancer hijacking as an explanation for the rapid evolution of HARs.

To address this issue, we sub-cloned candidate iPSC lines and deeply characterised their genetic properties using whole genome sequencing, their genomic stability upon CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, and their phenotypic properties including differentiation to commonly-used cell types. These studies identified KOLF2.1J as an all-around well-performing iPSC line. We then shared KOLF2.1J with groups around the world who tested its performance in head-to-head comparisons with their own preferred iPSC lines across a diverse range of differentiation protocols and functional assays. On the strength of these findings, we have made KOLF2.1J and hundreds of its gene-edited derivative clones readily accessible to promote the standardization required for large-scale collaborative science in the stem cell field.

SummaryThe authors of this collaborative study deeply characterized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to rationally select a clonally-derived cell line that performs well across multiple modalities. KOLF2.1J was identified as a candidate reference cell line based on single-cell analysis of its gene expression in the pluripotent state, whole genome sequencing, genomic stability after highly efficient CRISPR-mediated gene editing, integrity of the p53 pathway, and the efficiency with which it differentiated into multiple target cell populations. Since it is deeply characterized and can be readily acquired, KOLF2.1J is an attractive reference cell line for groups working with iPSCs.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been associated with abnormal cortical interneuron development, but which of the hundreds of NDD genes impact interneuron generation and migration into circuits and how they mediate these effects remain unknown. We previously developed a stem cell-based platform to study human cortical interneurons in self-organizing organoids resembling the ventral forebrain and their migration using forebrain assembloids. Here, we integrate assembloid technology with CRISPR screening to systematically investigate the involvement of 425 NDD genes in human interneuron development. The first screen aimed at interneuron generation revealed 13 candidate genes, including the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 and the canonical TGF{beta} signaling activator SMAD4. Then, we ran an interneuron migration screen in [~]1,000 forebrain assembloids that identified 33 candidate genes, including cytoskeleton-related genes and, notably, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related gene LNPK. Interestingly, we discovered that, during interneuron migration, the ER is displaced along the leading neuronal branch prior to nuclear translocation. Deletion of LNPK interfered with this ER displacement and resulted in reduced interneuron saltation length, indicating a critical role for the ER in this migratory process. Taken together, these results highlight how this versatile CRISPR-assembloid platform can be used to systematically map disease genes onto early stages of human neural development and to reveal novel mechanisms regulating interneuron development.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.06.506845,1,new results,01/06/2022,01/06/2022,,Xiangling Meng; David Yao; Xiaoyu Chen; Kevin W.

Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) previously described target the native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Envelope (Env), but the relevance of the tiered categories for inhibitors targeting another Env conformation, the pre-hairpin intermediate, is not well understood. Here we show that two inhibitors targeting distinct highly-conserved regions of the pre-hairpin intermediate have strikingly consistent neutralization potencies (within [~]100-fold for a given inhibitor) against strains in all three neutralization tiers of HIV-1; in contrast, best-in-class bnAbs targeting diverse Env epitopes vary by more than 10,000-fold in potency against these strains. Our results indicate that antisera-based HIV-1 neutralization tiers are not relevant for inhibitors targeting the pre-hairpin intermediate and highlight the potential for therapies and vaccine efforts targeting this conformation.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.06.511062,1,new results,01/07/2022,01/07/2022,,Benjamin N.

Real-time oxytocin imaging probes with the spatiotemporal resolution relevant to its endogenous signaling are required to fully elucidate oxytocin function in the brain. Herein we describe a near-infrared oxytocin nanosensor (nIROx), a synthetic probe capable of imaging oxytocin in the brain without interference from its structural analogue, vasopressin. nIROx leverages the inherent tissue-transparent fluorescence of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and the molecular recognition capacity of an oxytocin receptor peptide fragment (OXTp) to selectively and reversibly image oxytocin. We employ these nanosensors to monitor electrically stimulated oxytocin release in brain tissue, revealing oxytocin release sites with a median size of 3 m which putatively represents the spatial diffusion of oxytocin from its point of release. These data demonstrate that covalent SWCNT constructs such as nIROx are powerful optical tools that can be leveraged to measure neuropeptide release in brain tissue.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.05.511026,1,new results,01/07/2022,01/07/2022,,Nicole Navarro; Sanghwa Jeong; Nicholas Ouassil; Jaewan Mun; Esther Leem; Markita P.

Human microbiome data is biased towards industrialized populations, providing limited understanding of the distinct and diverse non-industrialized microbiomes. Here, we performed ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing and strain cultivation on 351 fecal samples from the Hadza, hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, and comparative populations in Nepal and California. We recover 94,971 total genomes of bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes, 43% of which are absent from existing unified datasets. Analysis of in situ growth rates, genetic pN/pS signatures, high-resolution strain tracking, and 124 gut-resident species vanishing in industrialized populations reveals differentiating dynamics of the Hadza gut microbiome. Industrialized gut microbes are enriched in genes associated with oxidative stress, possibly a result of microbiome adaptation to inflammatory processes.

Traditional approaches use regression to sequentially test multiplicative interaction terms involving single pairs of genetic variants. For higher-order interactions and genome-wide large-scale data, this strategy is computationally intractable. Moreover, multiplicative terms used in regression modeling may not capture the form of biological interactions. Building on the Predictability, Computability, Stability (PCS) framework, we introduce the epiTree pipeline to extract higher-order interactions from genomic data using tree-based models. The epiTree pipeline first selects a set of variants derived from tissue-specific estimates of gene expression. Next, it uses iterative random forests (iRF) to search training data for candidate Boolean interactions (pairwise and higher-order). We derive significance tests from interactions by simulating Boolean tree-structured null (no epistasis) and alternative (epistasis) distributions on hold-out test data. Finally, our pipeline computes PCS epistasis p-values that evaluate the stability of improvement in prediction accuracy via bootstrap sampling on the test set. We validate the epiTree pipeline using the phenotype of red-hair from the UK Biobank, where several genes are known to demonstrate epistatic interactions. epiTree recovers both previously reported and novel interactions, which represent forms of non-linearities not captured by logistic regression models. Additionally, epiTree suggests interactions between genes such as PKHD1 and XPOTP1, which are unlinked to MC1R, as novel candidate interactions associated with the red hair phenotype. Last but not least, we find that individual Boolean or tree-based epistasis models generally provide higher prediction accuracy than classical logistic regression.",,,biorxiv;2020.11.24.396846,2,new results,01/07/2022,01/07/2022,,Merle Behr; Karl Kumbier; Aldo Cordova-Palomera; Matthew Aguirre; Euan Ashley; Atul J.

TOGA scales to hundreds of genomes, which we demonstrate by applying it to 488 placental mammal and 308 bird assemblies, creating the largest comparative gene resources so far. Additionally, TOGA detects gene losses, enables selection screens, and automatically provides a superior measure of mammalian genome quality. Together, TOGA is a powerful and scalable method to annotate and compare genes in the genomic era.

Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples has revealed the composition of human gut microbiomes, but we remain less familiar with the spatial organization of microbes between regions such as lumen and mucosa, as well as the microbial genes that regulate this organization. To discover the determinants of spatial organization in the gut, we simulate mucosal colonization over time using an in vitro culture approach incorporating mucin hydrogel microcosms with a complex yet defined community of 123 human strains for which we generated high-quality genome assemblies. Tracking strain abundance longitudinally using shotgun metagenomic measurements, we observe distinct and strain-specific spatial organization in our cultures with strains enriched on mucin microcosms versus in supernatant, reminiscent of mucosa versus lumen enrichment in vivo. Our high taxonomic resolution data enables a comprehensive search for microbial genes that underlie this spatial organization. We identify gene families positively associated with microcosm-enrichment, including several known for biofilm and adhesion functions such as efflux pumps, gene expression regulation, and membrane proteases, as well as a novel link between a coenzyme F420 hydrogenase gene family and lipo/exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Our strain-resolved abundance measurements also demonstrate that incorporation of microcosms yields a more diverse community than liquid-only culture by allowing co-existence of closely related strains. Altogether these findings demonstrate that microcosm culture with synthetic communities can effectively simulate lumen versus mucosal regions in the gut, providing measurements of microbial organization with high taxonomic resolution to enable identification of specific bacterial genes and functions associated with spatial structure.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.13.507837,1,new results,01/13/2022,01/13/2022,,Xiaofan Jin; Feiqiao B.

AAVs with enhanced properties, such as more efficient and/or cell-type specific infection, can be engineered by creating a large, diverse starting library and screening for desired phenotypes, in some cases iteratively. Although this approach has succeeded in numerous specific cases, such as infecting cell types from the brain to the lung, the starting libraries often contain a high proportion of variants unable to assemble or package their genomes, a general prerequisite for engineering any gene delivery goal. Herein, we develop and showcase a machine learning (ML)-based method for systematically designing more effective starting libraries -- ones that have broadly good packaging capabilities while being as diverse as possible. Such carefully designed but general libraries stand to significantly increase the chance of success in engineering any property of interest. Furthermore, we use this approach to design a clinically-relevant AAV peptide insertion library that achieves 5-fold higher packaging fitness than the state-of-the-art library, with negligible reduction in diversity. We demonstrate the general utility of this designed library on a downstream task to which our approach was agnostic: infection of primary human brain tissue. The ML-designed library had approximately 10-fold more successful variants than the current state-of-the-art library.

This problem may be even harder when the host cell in question is the enucleated red blood cell. Evolution has provided P. falciparum and related single-celled parasites within the phylum Apicomplexa with a collection of organelles at their apical end that mediate invasion. This apical complex includes at least two sets of secretory organelles, micronemes and rhoptries, and several structural features like apical rings and a putative pore through which proteins may be introduced into the host cell during invasion. In this paper, we perform cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) on isolated merozoites to visualize the apical machinery. Through tomography reconstruction of cellular compartments, we see new details of known structures like the rhoptry tip interacting directly with a rosette resembling the recently described rhoptry-secretory-apparatus (RSA), or with an apical vesicle docked beneath the RSA. Subtomogram averaging reveals that the apical rings have a fixed number of repeating units, each of which is similar in overall size and shape to the units in the apical rings of tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii. Comparison of these polar rings in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma parasites also reveals them to have a structurally conserved assembly patterning.

Mapping phenotypes onto underlying sequence space at first- and higher order levels in order to independently quantify the impact of given nucleotides or residues along a sequence is critical to understanding sequence-phenotype relationships.

ResultsWe developed a Python software tool, ortho_seqs, that quantifies higher order sequence-phenotype interactions based on our previously published method of applying multivariate tensor-based orthogonal polynomials to biological sequences. Using this method, nucleotide or amino acid sequence information is converted to vectors, which are then used to build and compute the first- and higher order tensor-based orthogonal polynomials. We derived a more complete version of the mathematical method that includes projections that not only quantify effects of given nucleotides at a particular site, but also identify the effects of nucleotide substitutions. We show proof of concept of this method, provide a use case example as applied to synthetic antibody sequences, and demonstrate the application of ortho_seqs to other other sequence-phenotype datasets.

The nucleus protects the phage genome from canonical DNA-targeting immune systems, such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification. We hypothesized that the failure of common bacterial defenses creates selective pressure for immune systems that target the unique jumbo phage biology. Here, we identify the ""jumbo phage killer"" (Juk) immune system that is deployed by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to resist [ovbar]KZ. Juk immunity rescues the cell by preventing early phage transcription, DNA replication, and nucleus assembly. Phage infection is first sensed by JukA (formerly YaaW), which localizes rapidly to the site of phage infection at the cell pole, triggered by ejected phage factors. The effector protein JukB is recruited by JukA, which is required to enable immunity and the subsequent degradation of the phage DNA. JukA homologs are found in several bacterial phyla and are associated with numerous other putative effectors, many of which provided specific anti-[ovbar]KZ activity when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Together, these data reveal a novel strategy for immunity whereby immune factors are recruited to the site of phage protein and DNA ejection to prevent phage progression and save the cell.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.17.508391,1,new results,01/18/2022,01/18/2022,,Yuping Li; Jingwen Guan; Surabhi Hareendranath; Emily Crawford; David A.

The prevalent and disease-linked Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta performs several unusual chemical transformations, but it does not metabolize sugars and its core growth strategy remains unclear. To obtain a comprehensive view of the metabolic network of E. lenta, we generated several complementary resources: defined culture media, metabolomics profiles of strain isolates, and a curated genome-scale metabolic reconstruction. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics revealed that E. lenta uses acetate as a key carbon source while catabolizing arginine to generate ATP, traits which could be recapitulated in silico by our updated metabolic model. We compared these in vitro findings with metabolite shifts observed in E. lenta-colonized gnotobiotic mice, identifying shared signatures across environments and highlighting catabolism of the host signaling metabolite agmatine as an alternative energy pathway.

Disruption of these processes has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders including Huntingtons Disease (HD). While several treatments for physical and psychiatric HD symptoms target dopaminergic neuromodulation, the mechanism by which dopaminergic dysfunction occurs during HD is unknown. This is partly due to limited capability to visualize dopamine dynamics at the spatiotemporal resolution of both neuromodulator release (ms) and dopaminergic boutons ({micro}m). Here we employ near-infrared fluorescent catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to image dopamine release within the brain striatum of R6/2 Huntingtons Disease Model (R6/2) mice. We find that stimulated dorsal striatal dopamine release decreases with progressive motor degeneration and that these decreases are primarily driven by a decrease in the number of dopamine hotspots combined with decreased release intensity and decreased release fidelity. Using nIRCats high spatial resolution, we show that dopamine hotspots in late HD show increased ability to add new dopamine hotspots at high extracellular calcium concentrations and track individual dopamine hotspots over repeated stimulations and pharmacological wash to measure dopamine hotspots release fidelity. Compellingly, we demonstrate that antagonism of D2-autoreceptors using Sulpiride and direct blocking of Kv1.2 channels using 4-Aminopyradine (4-AP) increases the fidelity of dopamine hotspot activity in WT striatum but not in late HD striatum, indicating that D2-autoreceptor regulation of dopamine release through Kv1.2 channels is compromised in late HD. These findings, enabled by nIRCats, provide a more detailed look into how dopamine release is disrupted and dysregulated during Huntingtons Disease to alter the coverage of dopamine modulation across the dorsal striatum.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHuntingtons Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Dysfunction of dopamine signaling is known to deteriorate in HD but has not been studied at the spatial level of individual release sites. Here, we image dopamine release from individual hotspots in brain slices from R6/2 HD mice at early and late disease timepoints with dopamine nanosensors. We track single dopamine hotspots and find that dopamine hotspot number, release intensity, and release fidelity decrease in HD, and demonstrate that changes in D2-autoreceptor regulation manifest through changes in hotspot release fidelity thus compromising dopamine coverage across the dorsal lateral striatum. These findings highlight dopaminergic neurons in cortico-striatal signaling during HD as a promising new therapeutic target for HD treatment.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.19.508617,1,new results,01/21/2022,01/21/2022,,Sarah J.

Antibody responses from serologic surveys can provide an estimate of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at the population level.

ObjectiveTo estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and re-infection in eastern Uganda using serologic surveillance from 2020 to early 2022.

DesignPlasma samples from participants in the Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda (PRISM) Border Cohort were obtained at four sampling intervals: October-November 2020; March-April 2021; August-September 2021; and February-March 2022. Setting: Tororo and Busia districts, Uganda.

Participants1,483 samples from 441 participants living in 76 households were tested. Each participant contributed up to 4 time points for SARS-CoV-2 serology, with almost half of all participants contributing at all 4 time points, and almost 90% contributing at 3 or 4 time points. Information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status was collected from participants, with the earliest reported vaccinations in the cohort occurring in May 2021.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The main outcomes of this study were antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as measured with a bead-based serologic assay. Individual-level outcomes were aggregated to population-level SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and boosting rates. Estimates were weighted by the local age distribution based on census data.

ResultsBy the end of the Delta wave and before widespread vaccination, nearly 70% of the study population had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the subsequent Omicron wave, 85% of unvaccinated, previously seronegative individuals were infected for the first time, and [~]50% or more of unvaccinated, already seropositive individuals were likely re-infected, leading to an overall 96% seropositivity in this population. Our results suggest a lower probability of re-infection in individuals with higher pre-existing antibody levels. We found evidence of household clustering of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. We found no significant associations between SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and gender, household size, or recent Plasmodium falciparum malaria exposure.

Conclusions and RelevanceFindings from this study are consistent with very high infection rates and re-infection rates for SARS-CoV-2 in a rural population from eastern Uganda throughout the pandemic.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.20.22280170,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/21/2022,01/21/2022,,Jessica Briggs; Saki Takahashi; Patience Nayebare; Gloria Cuu; John Rek; Maato Zedi; Timothy Kizza; Emmanuel Arinaitwe; Joaniter I.

We investigated mechanisms of ICI resistance using engineered mouse models with increased neoantigen burden and T cell infiltration.

This resistance circuit was molecularly driven by IL-1, TNF, and G-CSF, and their genetic or pharmacologic inhibition increased ICI efficacy. Furthermore, we identified a subset of human TNF-expressing T cells that expand following ICI therapy and are associated with increased tumour NF-{kappa}B signaling.

We used two-photon holographic optogenetics to activate ensembles of neurons in Layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1) in the absence of external stimuli to isolate the impact of local recurrence from external inputs. We find that the spatial arrangement and the stimulus feature preference of both the stimulated and the target ensemble jointly determine the net effect of recurrent activity, defining the cortical activity patterns that drive competition versus facilitation in L2/3 circuits. Computational modeling suggests that a combination of highly local recurrent excitatory connectivity and selective convergence onto inhibitory neurons give rise to these principles of recurrent activity.

Rheological measurements to understand these flow-induced properties in soft condensed matter and biology are critical to optimize manufacturing processes that rely upon the use of complex fluids, such as the creation of viscoelastic bioinks for 3D bioprinting. While typical rheological characterizations are performed on bulky and expensive rheometers, these options do not readily enable in situ microscopic visualization of flow behavior, which can provide microstructural insights into the mechanisms and patterns of yielding. To address these limitations, we present a visual, inexpensive (approximately $200), and wireless capillary rheometer (VIEWR) assembled from chiefly 3D printed components. We validate the accuracy and reliability of the portable rheometer by comparing measurements of multiple rheological parameters, including viscosity and yield stress, with measurements obtained from a commercial oscillatory rheometer. At its core, VIEWR employs an easily interchangeable glass capillary channel to enable real-time microscopic observation under flow conditions. To facilitate various experimental conditions, a communication protocol based on Internet of Things (IoT) is adapted to support wireless transmission of data. This unique rheometer design can be used for characterizing and visualizing numerous living and non-living complex fluids.

We investigated if climate and environment modified the effect of low-cost, point-of-use water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) interventions on diarrhea and predicted intervention effectiveness under climate change scenarios.

MethodsWe analyzed data from a cluster-randomized trial in rural Bangladesh that measured diarrhea prevalence in children 0-2 years from 2012-2016. We matched remote sensing data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and surface water to households by location and measurement date. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for WASH interventions vs. control stratified by environmental factors using generative additive models and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. We estimated intervention effects under predicted precipitation in the study region in 2050 for climate change scenarios from different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).

FindingsWASH interventions more effectively prevented diarrhea under higher levels of total precipitation in the previous week and when there was heavy rain in the previous week (heavy rainfall PR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.62 vs. no heavy rainfall PR = 0.77, 0.60-0.98). We did not detect substantial effect modification by other environmental variables. WASH intervention effectiveness increased under most climate change scenarios; in a fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5), the PR was 0.46 (0.44-0.48) compared to 0.67 (0.65-0.68) in the study.

InterpretationWASH interventions had the strongest effect on diarrhea under higher precipitation, and effectiveness may increase under climate change without sustainable development. WASH interventions may improve population resilience to climate-related health risks.

In general, the effect modification of sanitation and hygiene on diarrhea or enteropathogen infection by climate and environment is not well studied. One study in Ecuador investigated different relationships between rainfall, diarrhea, and unimproved sanitation and water sources. They found that poor sanitation was most strongly associated with elevated diarrhea after precipitation minimums, whereas poor water sources were most strongly associated with elevated diarrhea after precipitation maximums. One study in Rwanda also found that high levels of runoff were protective against diarrhea only in households with unimproved toilets. In Bangladesh, one study found that access to tubewells was most effective at reducing childhood diarrhea in non-flood controlled areas. No prior studies have projected changes in WASH effectiveness under different climate change scenarios.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess differences in WASH intervention effectiveness for multiple environmental variables and the first to predict future intervention effectiveness under different climate change scenarios. We spatiotemporally matched individual-level data from a trial in rural Bangladesh to remote sensing data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and surface water presence. We compared the effectiveness of WASH interventions to prevent diarrhea under different levels of potential environmental effect modifiers. We then used climate models with high spatiotemporal resolution to predict changes in intervention effectiveness under different climate change scenarios.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found that WASH interventions were more effective under increasing precipitation and following heavy rain (over 80th percentile) events. Prior studies have found that diarrhea tends to increase with rainfall. Several studies have documented that precipitation-associated increases in diarrhea occurred primarily after heavy rain that followed dry periods, but we found that WASH intervention effectiveness in preventing diarrhea was higher even at moderate precipitation levels that were not necessarily preceded by a dry period. Under climate change scenarios with higher precipitation, we projected that WASH interventions may become more effective. In settings similar to rural Bangladesh, our findings suggest that regions that are expected to experience greater rainfall should be prioritized for intervention installation, promotion, and maintenance and that these activities might be most impactful during the rainy season.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.25.22280229,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/27/2022,01/27/2022,,Anna T.

MethodsWe matched spatiotemporal temperature, precipitation, surface water, and humidity data to data from a trial in rural Bangladesh that measured diarrhea and enteropathogen prevalence in children 0-2 years from 2012-2016. We fit generalized additive models and estimated percent changes in prevalence using projected precipitation under Shared Socio-Economic pathways describing sustainable development (SSP1), middle of the road (SSP2), and fossil fuel development (SSP5) scenarios.

FindingsAn increase from 15{degrees}C to 30{degrees}C in weekly average temperature was associated with 5.0% higher diarrhea, 6.4% higher Norovirus, and 13.0% higher STEC prevalence. Above-median precipitation was associated with 1.27-fold (95% CI 0.99, 1.61) higher diarrhea; higher Cryptosporidium, tEPEC, ST-ETEC, STEC, Shigella, EAEC, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, and Adenovirus 40/41; and lower aEPEC, Giardia, Sapovirus, and Norovirus prevalence. Other associations were weak or null. Compared to the study period, diarrhea prevalence was similar under SSP1 (7%), 3.4% (2.7%, 4.3%) higher under SSP2, and 5.7% (4.4%, 7.0%) higher under SSP5. Prevalence of pathogens responsible for a large share of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in this setting (Shigella, Aeromonas) were 13-20% higher under SSP2 and SSP5.

InterpretationHigher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher prevalence of diarrhea and multiple enteropathogens; higher precipitation was associated with lower prevalence of some enteric viruses. Under likely climate change scenarios, we projected increased prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens responsible for clinical illness. Our findings inform pathogen-specific adaptation and mitigation strategies and priorities for vaccine development.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and Scopus for studies published from January 1, 2000 to present using the following three queries: 1) child; and diarrhea OR ""enteric infection""; and meteorological OR environmental OR ""surface water"" OR ""standing water""; and risk AND/OR factors; 2) Climate AND change AND project* AND diarrhea OR diarrhoea; 3) climate AND change AND project* OR model AND enter* AND infect* AND E. coli. Studies generally focused on individual risk factors for diarrhea transmission or enteric infection, with an emphasis on temperature and precipitation. Studies found that higher temperatures were associated with higher incidence of bacterial diarrhea and lower incidence of viral diarrhea; few studies have investigated associations between temperature and parasitic diarrhea. Heavy rainfall, particularly after dry periods, was associated with higher diarrhea prevalence, though heavy rainfall during rainy seasons was found to protect against diarrhea incidence. Similarly, flooding of surface water and shallow wells was also associated with higher diarrhea prevalence. Very few studies investigated associations between diarrhea or enteropathogen carriage and surface water presence, or humidity. A recent individual participant meta-analysis of studies in 19 low- and middle-income countries found that higher precipitation was associated with a small decrease in enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Campylobacter spp. prevalence and no difference in Shigella, Cryptosporidium, or Giardia, or enteric virus prevalence. Weekly average temperature increases of 10-40{degrees} C within the study period were associated with higher risk of Campylobacter, ETEC, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and adenovirus, and lower risk of sapovirus and rotavirus, and generally, associations were stronger. Higher humidity was associated with higher risk of enteric bacterial infections and lower risk of enteric virus infection. A small number of studies have projected diarrhea under climate change in low- and middle-income countries. Studies have estimated a 15-20% increase in global diarrhea risk in 2040-2069 relative to 1961-1990, up to 21% increase in diarrhea incidence in northern India from 2013 to the 2040s, 3-10% increase in diarrhea cases in the Gaza Strip associated with 1.5{degrees} to 2{degrees}C increases in temperature, and an 8% increase in diarrhea burden by 2050 in Nepal. One study estimated an additional 1,625,073 ETEC diarrhea cases in Bangladesh from 2046-2065 due to climate change. No studies estimated changes in the presence of multiple enteropathogens under possible climate change scenarios.

Added value of this studyThis study matched remote sensing data on precipitation, temperature, surface water, and humidity to data on diarrhea and enteropathogen carriage in children under 2 years from a trial in rural Bangladesh. We fit flexible models to investigate potentially non-linear relationships between each climate and environmental risk factor and each health outcome. In addition, we predicted the prevalence of each outcome under three possible climate change scenarios. Our predictions leveraged the spatiotemporal distributions of both climate precipitation projections and diarrhea and enteropathogen carriage in the trial. To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict prevalence under climate change scenarios for both diarrhea and multiple enteropathogens in a rural, low-resource south Asian setting. Our study sheds light on how climate change may impact diarrhea and enteropathogen carriage in Bangladesh, which is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its low altitude and seasonal flooding.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found that both higher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher diarrhea prevalence, consistent with prior studies. Compared to prior studies, which have primarily found associations between diarrhea and heavy rainfall following a dry period, we found that moderate levels of weekly precipitation were associated with higher diarrhea prevalence. Relationships between climatic and environmental variables and enteropathogen carriage varied by taxa, as other studies have found, but for some pathogens and risk factors, we observed associations in different directions than prior studies. Under middle of the road and fossil fuel-based development climate change scenarios, we projected increased diarrhea prevalence and taxa-specific changes in enteropathogen prevalence. Our findings suggest that climate change may exacerbate diarrhea burden in rural Bangladesh in the absence of sustainable development and inform prioritization of pathogen-specific mitigation and/or adaptation interventions (e.g., vaccines) for young children in rural, South Asian settings under climate change.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.26.22280367,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/27/2022,01/27/2022,,Jessica A.

We predicted that 43% of HARs have variants with large opposing effects on chromatin state and 14% on neurodevelopmental enhancer activity. This pattern, consistent with compensatory evolution, was confirmed using massively parallel reporter assays in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells. The species-specific enhancer activity of assayed HARs was accurately predicted from the presence and absence of transcription factor footprints in each species. Despite these striking cis effects, activity of a given HAR sequence was nearly identical in human and chimpanzee cells. These findings suggest that HARs did not evolve to compensate for changes in the trans environment but instead altered their ability to bind factors present in both species.

The dysregulation of ceramide metabolism has been implicated in cancer evasion of apoptosis and targeting ceramide metabolism has potential therapeutic benefits as a strategy to kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to ceramide-mediated cell death are vastly intertwined and incompletely understood. To shed light on this mystery, we performed a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify regulators of cancer resistance to the soluble short chain ceramide, C6 ceramide (C6-Cer). Our results reveal a complex landscape of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity, including genes associated with ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and membrane biology. Furthermore, we find that loss of the phospholipid flippase subunit TMEM30A impairs the plasma membrane trafficking of its binding partner the P4-type ATPase ATP11B, and depletion of TMEM30A or ATP11B disrupts plasma membrane asymmetry and promotes resistance to C6-Cer toxicity independent of alterations in C6-Cer uptake. Together, our findings provide a resource of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity and reveal an unexpected role of plasma membrane asymmetry in C6-Cer induced cell death.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.26.509629,1,new results,01/28/2022,01/28/2022,,Siti Nur Sarah Morris; Kirandeep K.

To this end, we generated matched scRNA- and scATAC-seq profiles of human scalp biopsies, identifying diverse cell types of the hair follicle niche. By interrogating the integrated datasets across multiple levels of cellular resolution, we infer 50-100% more enhancer-gene links than prior approaches, and show that the aggregate accessibility at linked enhancers for highly-regulated genes predicts expression. We use these gene-regulatory maps to prioritize cell types, genes, and causal variants implicated in the pathobiology of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), eczema, and other complex traits. AGA GWAS signals are strongly and specifically enriched in dermal papilla cell open chromatin regions, supporting the role of these cells as key drivers of AGA pathogenesis. Finally, we trained machine-learning models to nominate SNPs that affect gene expression through disruption of specific transcription factor binding motifs, identifying candidate functional SNPs linked to expression of WNT10A in AGA and IL18RAP in eczema.

Yet the microbial functions that underpin this succession are not well described. Further, its unclear how previous precipitation frames microbial capacities after rewetting and how long these effects persist. We used isotopically-labeled water to rewet seasonally dry annual grassland soil that experienced either mean annual or reduced precipitation during the previous two years, and sampled at five subsequent time points. We used quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP)-informed genome- resolved metagenomics to identify growing microorganisms, predict their capabilities, and analyze how these traits differed over time and between precipitation treatments. Organisms that grew after wetup were more abundant than non-growing organisms prior to the wet-up, suggesting that traits that initiate succession are pre-defined at the end of the prior plant growing season or via survival over the summer. Fast-growing organisms had fewer carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) genes per genome than slower-growing organisms, suggesting that although fast-growers were capable of degrading complex C, they may not specialize in this process. Differential abundance of CAZy genes in growing organisms throughout the succession implies that substrate availability varied with time. In contrast, the abundance of peptidases in growing organisms differed between precipitation treatments, but not over time following wet-up. Before wet-up, the soil organisms gene inventories were different between the two precipitation treatments. Surprisingly, this legacy effect waned after just one week.

In recent years, manyadvancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines,and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especiallycomplex polygonal geometries.

Theresult embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream taskssuch as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. Toachieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirableproperties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutationinvariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties. We conductexperiments on two tasks: 1) shape classification based on MNIST; 2) spatialrelation prediction based on two new datasets - DBSR-46K and DBSR-cplx46K.

In thispaper, we instead consider a generalization of Shannon entropy from work instatistical decision theory (DeGroot 1962, Rao 1984), which contains a broadclass of uncertainty measures parameterized by a problem-specific loss functioncorresponding to a downstream task.

In thiswork, we develop a method that allows us to plan for exploration while takingboth the task and the current knowledge about the dynamics into account.

It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications.

Here, we present in situ cell-surface proteome extraction by extracellular labeling (iPEEL), a proximity labeling method in mice that enables spatiotemporally precise labeling of cell-surface proteomes in a cell-type-specific environment in native tissues for discovery proteomics. Applying iPEEL to developing and mature cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed differential enrichment in CSPs with post-translational protein processing and synaptic functions in the developing and mature cell-surface proteomes, respectively. A proteome-instructed in vivo loss-of-function screen identified a critical, multifaceted role for Armh4 in Purkinje cell dendrite morphogenesis. Armh4 overexpression also disrupts dendrite morphogenesis; this effect requires its conserved cytoplasmic domain and is augmented by disrupting its endocytosis.

Our objectives were to characterize the phenotype of patients with Nodding Syndrome, investigate potential contributors to disease etiology, and evaluate response to immunotherapy. This cohort study investigated members of a single-family unit from Lamwo District, Uganda. The participants for this study were selected by the Ugandan Ministry of Health as representative for Nodding Syndrome and with a conducive family structure for genomic analyses. Of the eight family members who participated in the study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, three had Nodding Syndrome. The three affected patients were extensively evaluated with metagenomic sequencing for infectious pathogens, exome sequencing, spinal fluid immune analyses, neurometabolic and toxicology testing, continuous electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. Five unaffected family members underwent a subset of testing for comparison. A distinctive interictal pattern of sleep-activated bursts of generalized and multifocal epileptiform discharges and slowing was observed in two patients. Brain imaging showed two patients had mild generalized cerebral atrophy, and both patients and unaffected family members had excessive metal deposition in the basal ganglia. Trace metal biochemical evaluation was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was non-inflammatory, and one patient had CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands. Onchocerca volvulus specific antibodies were present in all patients and skin snips were negative for active onchocerciasis. Metagenomic sequencing of serum and CSF revealed hepatitis B virus in the serum of one patient. Vitamin B6 metabolites were borderline low in all family members, and CSF pyridoxine metabolites were normal. Mitochondrial DNA testing was normal. Exome sequencing did not identify potentially causal candidate gene variants. Nodding Syndrome is characterized by a distinctive pattern of sleep-activated epileptiform activity. The associated growth stunting may be due to hypothalamic dysfunction. Extensive testing years after disease onset did not clarify a causal etiology.

Current serology assays either require a laboratory setting and take >1 hr (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) or are rapid but only qualitative in nature and cannot accurately track antibody levels over time (i.e., lateral flow assay [LFA]). Therefore, there is a need for development of a rapid and simple but also quantitative assay that can evaluate antibody levels in patients accurately over time. We have developed an assay that uses a split nanoluciferase fused to the spike or nucleocapsid proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enable luminescent-based detection of spike- or nucleocapsid-binding antibodies in serum, plasma, and whole blood samples. The resulting approach is simple, rapid, and quantitative and is highly amenable to low-/medium-throughput scale using plate-based assays, high-throughput scale using robotics, and point-of-care applications. In this article, we describe how to perform the assay in a laboratory setting using a plate reader or liquid-handling robotics and in a point-of-care setting using a handheld, battery-powered luminometer. Together, these assays allow antibody detection to be easily performed in multiple settings by simplifying and reducing assay time in a laboratory or clinical environment and by allowing for antibody detection in point-of-care, nonlaboratory settings. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Endogenous ligands for PPARγ are generated during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to fatty acids through the actions of lipases such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). To examine whether reduced production of endogenous PPARγ ligands would influence bone regeneration, we examined the effects of HSL knockout on fracture repair in mice using a tibial mono-cortical defect as a model. We found an improved rate of fracture repair in HSL-ko mice documented by serial μCT and bone histomorphometry compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, accelerated rates of bone regeneration were observed with a calvarial model where implantation of bone grafts from HSL-ko mice accelerated bone regeneration at the injury site. Further analysis revealed improved MSC differentiation down osteoblast and chondrocyte lineage with inhibition of HSL. MSC recruitment to the injury site was greater in HSL-ko mice than WT. Finally, we used single cell RNAseq to understand the osteoimmunological differences between WT and HSL-ko mice and found changes in the pre-osteoclast population. Our study shows HSL-ko mice as an interesting model to study improvements to bone injury repair.

Tested on spatial datasets from the mouse hypothalamus, cerebellum, visual cortex and neocortex, DIALOGUE identified MCPs associated with animal behavior and recovered spatial properties when tested on unseen data while outperforming other methods and metrics. In spatial data from human lung cancer, DIALOGUE identified MCPs marking immune activation and tissue remodeling. Applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data across individuals or regions, DIALOGUE uncovered MCPs marking Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis and resistance to cancer immunotherapy.

Whether ferroptosis sensitivity is governed by a single regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, based on the integration of 24 published chemical genetic screens combined with targeted follow-up experimentation, we find that the genetic regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity is highly variable and context-dependent. For example, the lipid metabolic gene acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) appears far more essential for ferroptosis triggered by direct inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) than by cystine deprivation. Despite this, distinct pro-ferroptotic stimuli converge upon a common lethal effector mechanism: accumulation of lipid peroxides at the plasma membrane.

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.",adaptation ; differentiation ; extrusion ; feedback ; stem cells ; tissue homeostasis,,,,,2022/7/20/6/0,2022/07/18,2022/7/20/6/0,Lucy Erin O'Brien,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; email: lucye@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.","Lucy Erin O'Brien: Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; email: lucye@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.",,,,,,0

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.","adaptive ; cognitive flexibility ; dopamine, sex differences, adolescent, reversal, adversity, mouse ; feeding ; food insecurity",,,,,2022/7/22/6/0,2022/07/20,2022/7/22/6/0,Wan Chen Lin ; Christine Liu ; Polina Kosillo ; Lung-Hao Tai ; Ezequiel Galarce ; Helen S Bateup ; Stephan Lammel ; Linda Wilbrecht,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.;Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.;Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.;Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.;Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.",actin tension ; endoplasmic reticulum ;

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",DNA damage ; SA-beta-Gal ; cell cycle ; cell size ; p16(INK4) ; palbociclib ; polyploidy ; proteomics ; senescence ; size-scaling,,,,,2022/8/21/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/8/21/6/0,Michael C Lanz ; Evgeny Zatulovskiy ; Matthew P Swaffer ; Lichao Zhang ; Ilayda Ilerten ; Shuyuan Zhang ; Dong Shin You ; Georgi Marinov ; Patrick McAlpine ; Joshua E Elias ; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, whereas others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each individual mutant in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, whereas others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with the same resistance gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with different resistance genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others. We add to a growing body of work describing the key role of phages in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host communities. Beyond this specific trait, our study provides a new insight into the genetic architecture of historical contingency, a crucial component of interpreting and predicting evolution.",bacteriophages ; epistasis ; experimental evolution ; historical contingency ; microbial evolution ; parallel evolution,,,,,2022/8/23/6/0,,2022/8/23/6/0,Reena Debray ; Nina De Luna ; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.;Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.;Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Reena Debray: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.Nina De Luna: Department of Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,10.1101/2022.02.10.479996,,,0

Here we report the development of an integrated nanomedicine-bioelectronics brain-machine interface that enables continuous and on-demand treatment of brain tumours, without open-skull surgery and toxicological side-effects on other organs. Near-infrared surface plasmon characteristics of our gold nanostars enabled the precise treatment of deep brain tumours in freely behaving mice. Moreover, the nanostars' surface coating enabled their selective diffusion in tumour tissues after intratumoral administration, leading to the exclusive heating of tumours for treatment.

CoRa provides a simple and intuitive metric with broad applicability to biological feedback systems.",control ; feedback ; homeostasis,,,,,2022/8/30/6/0,2022/08/29,2022/8/30/6/0,Mariana Gómez-Schiavon ; Hana El-Samad,,"Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Cell Design Initiative, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Cell Design Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.;Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Laboratorio Internacional de Investigación sobre el Genoma Humano, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Santiago de Querétaro 76230, México.; Millennium Science Initiative Program, Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Chilean National Agency for Research and Development, Santiago 8331150, Chile.","Mariana Gómez-Schiavon: Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Laboratorio Internacional de Investigación sobre el Genoma Humano, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Santiago de Querétaro 76230, México.; Millennium Science Initiative Program, Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Chilean National Agency for Research and Development, Santiago 8331150, Chile.Hana El-Samad: Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Cell Design Initiative, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Cell Design Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158.",,,10.1101/2020.10.09.334078,,,0

Defects in alternative splicing are associated with many heart diseases, yet relatively little is known about how cell type- or cell state-specific alternative splicing is achieved in the heart.

Nsp14 forms a stable complex with non-structural protein Nsp10 and exhibits exoribonuclease and N7-methyltransferase activities. Protein-interactome studies identified human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a putative binding partner of Nsp14. SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments. SIRT5 knock-out cells expressed higher basal levels of innate immunity markers and mounted a stronger antiviral response, independently of the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling Protein MAVS. Our results indicate that SIRT5 is a proviral factor necessary for efficient viral replication, which opens novel avenues for therapeutic interventions.",,,,,,2022/9/13/6/0,2022/09/12,2022/9/13/6/0,Marius Walter ;

One of the biggest problems is discriminating true signal generated by target molecules versus non-specific background. Here, we developed a Single-Molecule Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) that overcomes this problem by employing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to quantify target proteins based on the colocalization of fluorescent signal from orthogonally labeled capture and detection antibodies. By specifically counting colocalized signals, we can eliminate the effects of background produced by non-specific binding of detection antibodies. Using TNF-α, we show that SiMCA achieves a three-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays and exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such as serum and blood. Our results help define the pernicious effects of non-specific background in immunoassays and demonstrate the diagnostic gains that can be achieved by eliminating those effects.",,,,,,2022/9/14/6/0,2022/09/12,2022/9/14/6/0,Amani A Hariri ; Sharon S Newman ; Steven Tan ; Dan Mamerow ; Alexandra M Adams ; Nicolò Maganzini ; Brian L Zhong ; Michael Eisenstein ; Alexander R Dunn ; H Tom Soh,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.;Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.;Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. alex.dunn@stanford.edu.;Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.;Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.;Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. tsoh@stanford.edu.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. tsoh@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. tsoh@stanford.edu.;Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.","Amani A Hariri: Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Sharon S Newman: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Steven Tan: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Dan Mamerow: Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Alexandra M Adams: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Nicolò Maganzini: Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Brian L Zhong: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Michael Eisenstein: Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.Alexander R Dunn: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. alex.dunn@stanford.edu.H Tom Soh: Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. tsoh@stanford.edu.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. tsoh@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. tsoh@stanford.edu.",,,10.1101/2021.12.24.474141,,,0

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,,,,,2022/9/16/6/0,2022/09/15,2022/9/16/6/0,Brent Townshend ; Matias Kaplan ; Christina D Smolke,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.;Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.","Brent Townshend: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Matias Kaplan: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Christina D Smolke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.",,,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,,,0

However, the size and complexity of these Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes it difficult to perform exploratory analyses. To aid in data exploration, we have developed AIRRscape, an R Shiny-based interactive web browser application that enables B-cell receptor (BCR) and antibody feature discovery through comparisons among multiple repertoires. Using AIRR-seq data as input, AIRRscape starts by aggregating and sorting repertoires into interactive and explorable bins of germline V-gene, germline J-gene, and CDR3 length, providing a high-level view of the entire repertoire. Interesting subsets of repertoires can be quickly identified and selected, and then network topologies of CDR3 motifs can be generated for further exploration. Here we demonstrate AIRRscape using patient BCR repertoires and sequences of published monoclonal antibodies to investigate patterns of humoral immunity to three viral pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and DENV (dengue virus). AIRRscape reveals convergent antibody sequences among datasets for all three pathogens, although HIV-1 antibody datasets display limited convergence and idiosyncratic responses.

As cell size increases, some proteins become more concentrated while others are diluted. As a result, the state of the cell changes continuously with increasing size. In addition to these proteomic changes, large cells have a lower growth rate (protein synthesis rate per unit volume). That both the cell's proteome and growth rate change with cell size suggests they may be interdependent. To test this, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to measure how the proteome changes in response to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which decreases the cellular growth rate and has only a minimal effect on cell size. We found that large cell size and mTOR inhibition, both of which lower the growth rate of a cell, remodel the proteome in similar ways. This suggests that many of the effects of cell size are mediated by the size-dependent slowdown of the cellular growth rate. For example, the previously reported size-dependent expression of some senescence markers could reflect a cell's declining growth rate rather than its size ",cell size ; growth rate ; mTOR ; protein synthesis rate ; quantitative proteomics ; rapamycin ; senescence,,,,,2022/9/23/6/0,2022/09/05,2022/9/23/6/0,Evgeny Zatulovskiy ; Michael C Lanz ; Shuyuan Zhang ; Frank McCarthy ; Joshua E Elias ; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.","Evgeny Zatulovskiy: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.Michael C Lanz: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Shuyuan Zhang: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.Frank McCarthy: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Joshua E Elias: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Jan M Skotheim: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.",,,,,,0

We identified two distinct cellular targets of infection: adipocytes and a subset of inflammatory adipose tissue-resident macrophages.

We apply this model to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by fitting just one global parameter representing the frequency of interaction between individuals. We find that the predicted infections agree reasonably well with the reported cases. We clearly see the effect of ""shelter-in-place"" policies introduced at the onset of the pandemic. Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel. We find that this policy is successful in decreasing the epidemic size and slowing down the spread, but less effective than the shelter-in-place policy.

Tmem95 knockout murine sperm can bind to, but do not fuse with, eggs. How TMEM95 plays a role in membrane fusion of sperm and eggs has remained elusive. Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs.

However, its spatial and temporal resolution largely relies on the brightness of ON/OFF switchable fluorescent dyes. Moreover, in cell plasma membranes, the single-molecule localization is hampered by the fast lateral diffusion of membrane probes. Here, to address these two fundamental problems, we propose a concept of ON/OFF switchable probes for SMLM (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography, PAINT) based on fluorogenic dimers of bright cyanine dyes. In these probes, the two cyanine units connected with a linker were modified at their extremities with low-affinity membrane anchors. Being self-quenched in water due to intramolecular dye H-aggregation, they displayed light up on reversible binding to lipid membranes. The charged group in the linker further decreased the probe affinity to the lipid membranes, thus accelerating its dynamic reversible ON/OFF switching. The concept was validated on cyanines 3 and 5. SMLM of live cells revealed that the new probes provided higher brightness and ∼10-fold slower diffusion at the cell surface, compared to reference probes Nile Red and DiD, which boosted axial localization precision >3-fold down to 31 nm. The new probe allowed unprecedented observation of nanoscale fibrous protrusions on plasma membranes of live cells with 40 s time resolution, revealing their fast dynamics. Thus, going beyond the brightness limit of single switchable dyes by cooperative dequenching in fluorogenic dimers and slowing down probe diffusion in biomembranes open the route to significant enhancement of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of live cells.",,,,,,2022/9/27/6/0,2022/09/26,2022/9/27/6/0,Ilya O Aparin ; Rui Yan ; Rémi Pelletier ; Alexander A Choi ; Dmytro I Danylchuk ; Ke Xu ; Andrey S Klymchenko,,"Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.;Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.","Ilya O Aparin: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Rui Yan: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Rémi Pelletier: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Alexander A Choi: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Dmytro I Danylchuk: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Ke Xu: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Andrey S Klymchenko: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.",,,,,,0

Given that brief intervention can effectively reduce hazardous alcohol consumption, this study aimed to investigate how hypertensive patients with concomitant alcohol use are identified and treated in Thai primary care settings and what this may mean for screening and lifestyle intervention strategies. In a cross-sectional, mixed-method design, we surveyed 91 participants from three different groups of Thai stakeholders: policy- and decisionmakers; healthcare practitioners; and patients diagnosed with hypertension. Data was collected between December 2020 and May 2021. Responses were analyzed descriptively and using open coding tools to identify current practices, barriers, facilitators, and implications for interventions. All stakeholder groups regarded alcohol use as an important driver of hypertension. While lifestyle interventions among hypertensive patients were perceived as beneficial, current lifestyle support was limited. Barriers included limited resources in primary healthcare facilities, lack of continuous monitoring or follow-up, missing tools or procedures for risk assessment and lifestyle intervention, and stigmatization of alcohol use. Our results suggest that although screening for lifestyle risk factors (including alcohol use) and lifestyle interventions are not yet sufficiently established, a wide range of stakeholders still recognize the potential of interventions targeted at hazardous alcohol use among hypertensive patients. Future interventions may establish standardized assessment tools, be tailored to high-risk groups, and include electronic or remote elements.",Alcohol use ; Hypertension ; Lifestyle intervention ; Primary Health Care ; Screening and brief intervention ; Stakeholder survey ; Thailand,,,,,2022/9/27/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/9/27/6/0,Julia M Lemp ; Supa Pengpid ; Doungjai Buntup ; Till W Bärnighausen ; Pascal Geldsetzer ; Karl Peltzer ; Jürgen Rehm ; Bundit Sornpaisarn ; Charlotte Probst,,"ASEAN Institute for Health Development, Mahidol University, Salaya, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.;ASEAN Institute for Health Development, Mahidol University, Salaya, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.; Department of Research Administration and Development, University of Limpopo, Turfloop, South Africa.;Department of Research Administration and Development, University of Limpopo, Turfloop, South Africa.; Department of Psychology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.;Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.; Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI), KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.; Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University, Ratchathewi, Bangkok, Thailand.;Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.; Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; I.M.

To reduce this artifact burden, an improved amplification technique, primary template-directed amplification (PTA), was recently introduced. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 52 PTA-amplified single neurons using SCAN2, a new genotyper we developed to leverage mutation signatures and allele balance in identifying somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in PTA data. Our analysis confirms an increase in nonclonal somatic mutation in single neurons with age, but revises the estimated rate of this accumulation to 16 SNVs per year. We also identify artifacts in other amplification methods. Most importantly, we show that somatic indels increase by at least three per year per neuron and are enriched in functional regions of the genome such as enhancers and promoters.

Leveraging this hypothesis, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have assisted in both the interpretation and discovery of additional genes associated with complex traits. However, existing methods for conducting TWAS do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We introduce CONTENT-a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We apply CONTENT to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell RNA-seq data sets and show that CONTENT leads to a 42% (bulk) and 110% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. We find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75% in single-cell data, consistent with cell-type heterogeneity in bulk tissue. In the context of TWAS, CONTENT increases the number of locus-phenotype associations discovered by over 51% relative to previous methods across 22 complex traits.",,,,,,2022/9/29/6/0,2022/09/28,2022/9/29/6/0,Mike Thompson ; Mary Grace Gordon ; Andrew Lu ; Anchit Tandon ; Eran Halperin ; Alexander Gusev ; Chun Jimmie Ye ; Brunilda Balliu ; Noah Zaitlen,,"Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Biological and Medical Informatics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.;Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. mjthompson@ucla.edu.;Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.; Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.;Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Human Genetics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.;Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, Delhi, India.;Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, US.; Division of Genetics, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, US.;UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.","Mike Thompson: Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. mjthompson@ucla.edu.Mary Grace Gordon: Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Biological and Medical Informatics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Andrew Lu: UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Anchit Tandon: Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, Delhi, India.Eran Halperin: Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Human Genetics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Alexander Gusev: Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, US.; Division of Genetics, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, US.Chun Jimmie Ye: Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Brunilda Balliu: Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Noah Zaitlen: Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.; Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.",,,10.1101/2021.09.23.461579,,,0

We observed lower FcRγ protein expression in NK cell subsets from lung transplant patients during rapamycin treatment, suggesting a link with reduced mTOR activity. Further, FcRγ-/low NK cell subsets from healthy donors displayed reduced mTOR activity. We discovered that FcRγ upregulation is dependent on cell proliferation progression mediated by IL-2, IL-15, or IL-12, is sensitive to mTOR suppression, and is inhibited by TGFβ or IFNα. Accordingly, the accumulation of adaptive-like FcRγ-/low NK cells in COVID-19 patients corresponded to increased TGFβ and IFNα levels and disease severity. Our results show that an adaptive-like NK cell phenotype is induced by diminished cell proliferation and has an early prognostic value for increased TGFβ and IFNα levels in COVID-19 infection associated with disease severity.",,,,,,2022/9/7/6/0,2022/09/06,2022/9/7/6/0,Avishai Shemesh ; Yapeng Su ; Daniel R Calabrese ; Daniel Chen ; Janice Arakawa-Hoyt ; Kole T Roybal ; James R Heath ; John R Greenland ; Lewis L Lanier,,"Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.; Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.; University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.;Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.;Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.;Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; Department of Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.","Avishai Shemesh: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.Yapeng Su: Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.Daniel R Calabrese: Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.; Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.Daniel Chen: Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; Department of Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Janice Arakawa-Hoyt: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.Kole T Roybal: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.; University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.James R Heath: Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.John R Greenland: Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.; Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.Lewis L Lanier: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.",,,,,,0

When HARs were discovered in 2006, their function was mysterious due to scant annotation of the noncoding genome. Diverse technologies, from transgenic animals to machine learning, have consistently shown that HARs function as gene regulatory enhancers with significant enrichment in neurodevelopment. It is now possible to quantitatively measure the enhancer activity of thousands of HARs in parallel and model how each nucleotide contributes to gene expression. These strategies have revealed that many human HAR sequences function differently than their chimpanzee orthologs, though individual nucleotide changes in the same HAR may have opposite effects, consistent with compensatory substitutions. To fully evaluate the role of HARs in human evolution, it will be necessary to experimentally and computationally dissect them across more cell types and developmental stages.

PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.",disease models ; genetics ; genome engineering ; genomics ; hPSCs ; human ; parkinson's disease ; prime editing ; regenerative medicine ; stem cells,,,,,2022/9/8/6/0,2022/09/07,2022/9/8/6/0,Hanqin Li ; Oriol Busquets ; Yogendra Verma ; Khaja Mohieddin Syed ; Nitzan Kutnowski ; Gabriella R Pangilinan ; Luke A Gilbert ; Helen S Bateup ; Donald C Rio ; Dirk Hockemeyer ; Frank Soldner,,"Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network, Chevy Chase, United States.; Dominick P.

Here, we created a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain NCIB 3610 and investigated growth, biofilm colony wrinkling, and sporulation phenotypes of the knockdown library. First, we showed that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. Second, we quantified biofilm colony wrinkling using a custom image analysis algorithm and found that fatty acid synthesis and DNA gyrase knockdown strains exhibited increased wrinkling independent of biofilm matrix gene expression. Third, we designed a high-throughput screen to quantify sporulation efficiency after essential gene knockdown; we found that partial knockdowns of essential genes remained competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but knockdown of essential genes involved in fatty acid synthesis exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. We conclude that a subset of essential genes are particularly important for biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes.

Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis of the SETD3-2A interaction and a framework for the rational design of host-directed therapeutics against enteroviruses.",,,,,,2022/9/9/6/0,2022/09/08,2022/9/9/6/0,Christine E Peters ; Ursula Schulze-Gahmen ; Manon Eckhardt ; Gwendolyn M Jang ; Jiewei Xu ; Ernst H Pulido ; Conner Bardine ; Charles S Craik ; Melanie Ott ; Or Gozani ; Kliment A Verba ; Ruth Hüttenhain ; Jan E Carette ; Nevan J Krogan,,"Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. carette@stanford.edu.;Gladstone Institute of Virology, The J.

Transport to lysosomes relies on GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-mediated tagging of soluble enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency leads to the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). Several viruses require lysosomal cathepsins to cleave structural proteins and thus depend on functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. We used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET, also named TMEM251) as essential for infection by cathepsin-dependent viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). LYSET deficiency resulted in global loss of M6P tagging and mislocalization of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from the Golgi complex to lysosomes.

These mostly ineffective antibodies target variable epitopes. Here we describe broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors developed by tethering the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to known non-neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved epitopes in the viral spike protein. These inhibitors, called receptor-blocking conserved non-neutralizing antibodies (ReconnAbs), potently neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. Neutralization potency is lost when the linker joining the binding and inhibitory ReconnAb components is severed. In addition, a bi-functional ReconnAb, made by linking ACE2 to a bi-specific antibody targeting two non-overlapping conserved epitopes, defined here, shows sub-nanomolar neutralizing activity against all VOCs, including Omicron and BA.2. Given their conserved targets and modular nature, ReconnAbs have the potential to act as broad-spectrum therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pandemic diseases.",,,,,,2022/9/9/6/0,2022/09/08,2022/9/9/6/0,Payton A-B Weidenbacher ; Eric Waltari ; Izumi de Los Rios Kobara ; Benjamin N Bell ; Mary Kate Morris ; Ya-Chen Cheng ; Carl Hanson ; John E Pak ; Peter S Kim,,"California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.;Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.;Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.;Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.","Payton A-B Weidenbacher: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Eric Waltari: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Izumi de Los Rios Kobara: Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Benjamin N Bell: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Mary Kate Morris: California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.Ya-Chen Cheng: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Carl Hanson: California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.John E Pak: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Peter S Kim: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.",,,,,,0
