Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the ""proton wire"" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.25.525534,1,new results,2023-01-26,01/26/2023,,Chandrima Majumdar; Joshua A.

By analyzing >400,000 lineages across four human Bacteroides strains in gnotobiotic mice, we observed positive selection on thousands of previously hidden mutations -- most of which were unrelated to their original gene knockouts. The spectrum of fitness benefits varied between species, and displayed diverse tradeoffs over time and in different dietary conditions, enabling inferences of their underlying function.
