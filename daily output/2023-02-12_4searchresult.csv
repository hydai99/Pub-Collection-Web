Tom Soh,,,Hyongsok Tom Soh,Stanford University,bioRxiv,10.1101/2023.02.07.527534,,Extending the dynamic range of biomarker quantification through molecular equalization,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.07.527534v1,"Precision medicine requires highly scalable methods of multiplexed biomarker quantification that can accurately describe patient physiology. Unfortunately, contemporary molecular detection methods are generally limited to a dynamic range of sensitivity spanning just 3-4 orders of magnitude, whereas the actual physiological dynamic range of the human plasma proteome spans more than 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely on sample splitting and differential dilution to compensate for this mismatch, but such measures greatly limit the reproducibility and scalability that can be achieved--in particular, the effects of non-linear dilution can greatly confound the analysis of multiplexed assays. We describe here a two- pronged strategy for equalizing the signal generated by each analyte in a multiplexed panel, thereby enabling simultaneous quantification of targets spanning a wide range of concentrations. We apply our  EVROS strategy to a proximity ligation assay and demonstrate simultaneous quantification of four analytes present at concentrations spanning from low femtomolar to mid-nanomolar levels. In this initial demonstration, we achieve a dynamic range spanning seven orders of magnitude in a single 5 {micro}l sample of undiluted human serum, highlighting the opportunity to achieve sensitive, accurate detection of diverse analytes in a highly multiplexed fashion.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.07.527534,1,new results,2023-02-08,02/08/2023,,Sharon S.

Here we report TransitID, a method for unbiased mapping of endogenous proteome trafficking with nanometer spatial resolution in living cells. Two proximity labeling (PL) enzymes, TurboID and APEX, are targeted to source and destination compartments, and PL with each enzyme is performed in tandem via sequential addition of their small-molecule substrates. Mass spectrometry identifies the proteins tagged by both enzymes. Using TransitID, we mapped proteome trafficking between cytosol and mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus, and nucleolus and stress granules, uncovering a role for stress granules in protecting the transcription factor JUN from oxidative stress. TransitID also identifies proteins that signal intercellularly between macrophages and cancer cells.

The underlying pathophysiology of Long COVID remains unknown. Given that autoantibodies have been found to play a role in severity of COVID infection and certain other post-COVID sequelae, their potential role in Long COVID is important to investigate. Here we apply a well-established, unbiased, proteome-wide autoantibody detection technology (PhIP-Seq) to a robustly phenotyped cohort of 121 individuals with Long COVID, 64 individuals with prior COVID-19 who reported full recovery, and 57 pre-COVID controls. While a distinct autoreactive signature was detected which separates individuals with prior COVID infection from those never exposed to COVID, we did not detect patterns of autoreactivity that separate individuals with Long COVID relative to individuals fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The precise nature of this attenuation remains unknown as generating replication-competent viral genomes is challenging because of the length of the viral genome (30kb). Here, we designed a plasmid-based viral genome assembly and rescue strategy (pGLUE) that constructs complete infectious viruses or noninfectious subgenomic replicons in a single ligation reaction with >80% efficiency. Fully sequenced replicons and infectious viral stocks can be generated in 1 and 3 weeks, respectively. By testing a series of naturally occurring viruses as well as Delta-Omicron chimeric replicons, we show that Omicron nonstructural protein 6 harbors critical attenuating mutations, which dampen viral RNA replication and reduce lipid droplet consumption. Thus, pGLUE overcomes remaining barriers to broadly study SARS-CoV-2 replication and reveals deficits in nonstructural protein function underlying Omicron attenuation.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.31.525914,1,new results,2023-02-09,02/09/2023,,Taha Y.

In critically ill patients, anti-cytokine antibodies were far more common in infected versus uninfected patients.

Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, despite responding to different transcription factors, all even-skipped enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their trans-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic even-skipped transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic even-skipped expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping even-skipped bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.09.527927,1,new results,2023-02-10,02/10/2023,,Augusto Berrocal; Nicholas C Lammers; Hernan G Garcia; Michael B Eisen,"Berrocal, A.; Lammers, N.

This paradigm restricts the analysis to concepts that are known and well-characterized. Here, we present the novel multilingual translation method BioTranslator to address this problem. BioTranslator takes a user-written textual description of a new concept and then translates this description to a non-text biological data instance. The key idea of BioTranslator is to develop a multilingual translation framework, where multiple modalities of biological data are all translated to text. We demonstrate how BioTranslator enables the identification of novel cell types using only a textual description and how BioTranslator can be further generalized to protein function prediction and drug target identification. Our tool frees scientists from limiting their analyses within predefined controlled vocabularies, enabling them to interact with biological data using free text.",,,,,,2023-02-10,2023/02/10,2023/2/10,Hanwen Xu; Addie Woicik; Hoifung Poon; Russ B Altman; Sheng Wang,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. swang@cs.washington.edu.","Hanwen Xu: School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Addie Woicik: School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Hoifung Poon: Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA.Russ B Altman: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Sheng Wang: School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. swang@cs.washington.edu.",,,,,,0
