Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies. The network nature of hormone regulation and the principles discovered here further emphasize the importance of a systems approach to understanding hormone regulation.",,,biorxiv;2021.12.13.472243,2,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,"Liu, S.; Ezran, C.; Wang, M.

Current approaches for estimating and analyzing RNA velocity can empirically reveal complex dynamics but lack effective strategies for quantifying the uncertainty of the estimate and its overall applicability to the system of interest. Here, we present veloVI (velocity variational inference), a deep generative modeling framework for estimating RNA velocity. veloVI learns a gene-specific dynamical model of RNA metabolism and provides a transcriptome-wide quantification of velocity uncertainty. We show in a series of examples that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches for inferring RNA velocity with improvements in fit to the data, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells, and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that properties unique to veloVI, such as posterior velocity uncertainty, can be used to assess the appropriateness of analysis with velocity to the data at hand. Finally, we highlight veloVI as a flexible framework for modeling transcriptional dynamics by adapting the underlying dynamical model to use time-dependent transcription rates.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.12.503709,1,new results,01/15/2022,01/15/2022,,"Gayoso, A.; Weiler, P.; Lotfollahi, M.; Klein, D.; Hong, J.; Streets, A.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS.

Despite this, we currently lack a predictive understanding of how leaf-associated bacterial communities are structured within and across hosts, including how leaf traits shape this variation and how community assembly processes may differ across distinct microbial habitats on a leaf. In this study, we characterize the composition of bacterial phyllosphere communities from the upper and lower leaf surfaces of 66 plants across 24 species grown at a common site using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing leaves that vary in pH and stomatal densities and analyzing the leaf surfaces separately, we were able to test the key factors shaping the phyllosphere across host plant species from diverse geographical origins. We found a surprisingly large shared/core microbiome across species, as well as a strong effect of plant species and native origin in shaping composition. Importantly, we found the lower leaf side, where pH values are generally lower and stomatal densities higher, to have lower taxonomic richness relative to the upper leaf side. While the upper leaf side community appears to be more strongly influenced by dispersal effects, the lower leaf appears to be more strongly influenced by plant host filtering effects, as supported by higher relative abundance of shared core taxa and higher signatures of endemism.

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.

MethodsWe collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.

ResultsAmong 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples. Among 1,321 RT-PCR positive samples, 938/1321 (71%) were detected by BinaxNOW; 95% (774/817) of those with Ct value <30 were detected by BinaxNOW. BinaxNOW detection was consistent over lineages. In analyses to evaluate entry to treatment, BinaxNOW detected 82.7% (410/496, 95% CI: 79-86%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In comparison, RT-PCR (24-hour turnaround) detected 83.1% (412/496 95% CI: 79-86%) and RT-PCR (48-hour turnaround) detected 66.3% (329/496 95% CI: 62-70%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW detected high viral load from anterior nasal swabs consistently across omicron sublineages emerging between January and June of 2022.

While many studies have focused on tick-borne bacteria, far less is known about tick-associated viruses and their roles in public health or tick physiology. To address this, we investigated patterns of bacterial and viral communities across two field populations of western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 100 individual ticks, we quantified taxon prevalence, abundance, and co-occurrence with other members of the tick microbiome. Our analysis revealed 11 novel RNA viruses from Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Picornaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Reoviridae, Solemovidiae, Narnaviridae, and 2 highly divergent RNA viruses lacking sequence similarity to known viral families. The majority of these viruses were also detectable in lab-raised ticks at all developmental life stages, localize to tick salivary glands, and show evidence of circulation in mice fed on by ticks. These data suggest that viruses are stable, heritable, and transmissible members of the tick microbiota. We also unexpectedly identified numerous virus-like transcripts that are associated with tick genomic DNA, most of which are distinct from known endogenous viral element-mediated immunity pathways in invertebrates. Together, our work reveals that in addition to potentially serving as vectors for potential viral pathogens, I. pacificus ticks may also have symbiotic partnerships with their own vertically-transmitted viruses or with ancient viruses through evolutionarily acquired virus-like transcripts.

In recent years, manyadvancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines,and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especiallycomplex polygonal geometries. In this work, we focus on developing ageneral-purpose polygon encoding model, which can encode a polygonal geometry(with or without holes, single or multipolygons) into an embedding space. Theresult embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream taskssuch as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. Toachieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirableproperties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutationinvariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties.

Existinginformation-theoretic BO procedures aim to make queries that most reduce theuncertainty about optima, where the uncertainty is captured by Shannon entropy.However, an optimal measure of uncertainty would, ideally, factor in how weintend to use the inferred quantity in some downstream procedure. In thispaper, we instead consider a generalization of Shannon entropy from work instatistical decision theory (DeGroot 1962, Rao 1984), which contains a broadclass of uncertainty measures parameterized by a problem-specific loss functioncorresponding to a downstream task. We first show that special cases of thisentropy lead to popular acquisition functions used in BO procedures such asknowledge gradient, expected improvement, and entropy search. We then show howalternative choices for the loss yield a flexible family of acquisitionfunctions that can be customized for use in novel optimization settings.Additionally, we develop gradient-based methods to efficiently optimize ourproposed family of acquisition functions, and demonstrate strong empiricalperformance on a diverse set of sequential decision making tasks, includingvariants of top-$k$ optimization, multi-level set estimation, and sequencesearch.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01383,arXiv:2210.01383v1,,,10/04/2022,10/04/2022,,,"Willie Neiswanger, Lantao Yu, Shengjia Zhao, Chenlin Meng, Stefano Ermon",,,,,,,,0,

In thiswork, we develop a method that allows us to plan for exploration while takingboth the task and the current knowledge about the dynamics into account. Thekey insight to our approach is to plan an action sequence that maximizes theexpected information gain about the optimal trajectory for the task at hand.

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action tothe AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promisingdirections for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI.

Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labelsrequired) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinicaldomain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements.

In this work, we develop RNA-ODE, a principled computational framework that extends RNA velocity to quantify systems level dynamics and improve single-cell data analysis. We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism. Given a snapshot of gene expression at one time, RNA-ODE is able to predict and extrapolate the expression trajectory of each cell by solving the dynamic equations. Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also infers gene regulatory networks and identifies influential genes whose expression changes can decide cell fate.

We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",,,,,,2022/8/16/6/0,2022/08/15,2022/8/16/6/0,Takayoshi Shirasaki ;

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",DNA damage ; SA-beta-Gal ; cell cycle ; cell size ; p16(INK4) ; palbociclib ; polyploidy ; proteomics ; senescence ; size-scaling,,,,,2022/8/21/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/8/21/6/0,Michael C Lanz ; Evgeny Zatulovskiy ; Matthew P Swaffer ; Lichao Zhang ; Ilayda Ilerten ; Shuyuan Zhang ; Dong Shin You ; Georgi Marinov ; Patrick McAlpine ; Joshua E Elias ; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

Responses were analyzed descriptively and using open coding tools to identify current practices, barriers, facilitators, and implications for interventions. All stakeholder groups regarded alcohol use as an important driver of hypertension. While lifestyle interventions among hypertensive patients were perceived as beneficial, current lifestyle support was limited. Barriers included limited resources in primary healthcare facilities, lack of continuous monitoring or follow-up, missing tools or procedures for risk assessment and lifestyle intervention, and stigmatization of alcohol use. Our results suggest that although screening for lifestyle risk factors (including alcohol use) and lifestyle interventions are not yet sufficiently established, a wide range of stakeholders still recognize the potential of interventions targeted at hazardous alcohol use among hypertensive patients. Future interventions may establish standardized assessment tools, be tailored to high-risk groups, and include electronic or remote elements.",Alcohol use ; Hypertension ; Lifestyle intervention ; Primary Health Care ; Screening and brief intervention ; Stakeholder survey ; Thailand,,,,,2022/9/27/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/9/27/6/0,Julia M Lemp ; Supa Pengpid ; Doungjai Buntup ; Till W Bärnighausen ; Pascal Geldsetzer ; Karl Peltzer ; Jürgen Rehm ; Bundit Sornpaisarn ; Charlotte Probst,,"ASEAN Institute for Health Development, Mahidol University, Salaya, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.;ASEAN Institute for Health Development, Mahidol University, Salaya, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.; Department of Research Administration and Development, University of Limpopo, Turfloop, South Africa.;Department of Research Administration and Development, University of Limpopo, Turfloop, South Africa.; Department of Psychology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.;Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.; Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI), KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.; Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University, Ratchathewi, Bangkok, Thailand.;Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.; Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; I.M.
