In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1,new results,2023-01-07,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.

With over 44,000 nuclei and 6,000 cells analyzed, the data provide identification of rare cell types, mapping of intermediate steps in differentiation, and the potential to identify new factors impacting fertility or controlling differentiation of germline and supporting somatic cells. We justify assignment of key germline and somatic cell types using combinations of known markers, in situ hybridization, and analysis of extant protein traps. Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation. To complement the web-based portals for data analysis hosted by the FCA, we provide datasets compatible with commonly used software such as Seurat and Monocle.

While the structural features required for conserved autophagy functions of Atg8 are well established, little is known about the molecular changes that facilitated acquisition of divergent, nonautophagic functions of Atg8. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum offers a unique opportunity to study nonautophagic functions of Atg8 family proteins because it encodes a single Atg8 homolog whose only essential function is in the inheritance of an unusual secondary plastid called the apicoplast. Here, we used functional complementation to investigate the structure-function relationship for this divergent Atg8 protein.
