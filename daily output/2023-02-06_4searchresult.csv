Pharmacological interventions are the primary treatment, but the drug cure rate is low with side effects. There is an urgent need to develop novel treatment approaches. High frequency electrical stimulation (KHES) has been widely applied in clinical analgesia. However, its mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, datasets related to neuropathic pain were obtained from the GEO database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key genes were analyzed through functional enrichment analysis, showing that most of the pathways involve the inflammation. The MyD88 and NFκB pathways were further studied. KHES significantly alleviated mechanical and thermal allodynia in chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve mice. KHES also inhibited the increase in Myd88 and p-NFκB expression. The administration of NFκB pathway activator partly reversed the antinociceptive effects of KHES, and NFκB pathway inhibitor achieved analgesic effects similar to those of KHES. Therefore, KHES might be a novel intervention for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",Electrical stimulation; Inflammatory response; NFκB pathway; Neuropathic pain,,,,,2023-01-14,2023/01/10,2023/1/14,Peixin Lu; Kexin Fang; Wen Cheng; Bin Yu,,"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

For increased controllability, multi-input switches that integrate several cooperating and competing signals for the regulation of a shared output are of particular interest. The nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily offers promising starting points for engineering multi-input-controlled responses to clinically approved drugs. Starting from the VgEcR/RXR pair, we demonstrate that novel (multi-)drug regulation can be achieved by exchange of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) ligand binding domain (LBD) for other human NHR-derived LBDs. For responses activated to saturation by an agonist for the first LBD, we show that outputs can be boosted by an agonist targeting the second LBD. In combination with an antagonist, output levels are tunable by up to three simultaneously present small-molecule drugs. Such high-level control validates NHRs as a versatile, engineerable platform for programming multi-drug-controlled responses.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.01.526549,1,new results,2023-02-01,02/01/2023,,Simon Kretschmer; Nicholas Perry; Yang Zhang; Tanja Kortemme,"Kretschmer, S.; Perry, N.; Zhang, Y.; Kortemme, T.","Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California; California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California; California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF; University of California, Berkeley—University of California, San Francisco Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California; California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California; California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF; University of California, Berkeley—University of California, San Francisco Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering","Simon Kretschmer, Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF], [Nicholas Perry, Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF, University of California, Berkeley—University of California, San Francisco Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering], [Yang Zhang, Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF], [Tanja Kortemme, Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, California Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) at UCSF, University of California, Berkeley—University of California, San Francisco Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering",NA,,,,,0

However, how changes in the mechanical properties of the ECM are converted into biochemical signals that direct tumor cell migration and metastasis remains poorly characterized. Here, we describe a new role for the autophagy-inducing serine/threonine kinases ULK1 and ULK2 in mechanotransduction. We demonstrate that ULK1/2 activity inhibits the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (FAs), and as a consequence impedes cell contraction and migration. Mechanistically, we identify PXN/paxillin, a key component of the mechanotransducing machinery, as a direct binding partner and substrate of ULK1/2. ULK-mediated phosphorylation of PXN at S32 and S119 weakens homotypic interactions and liquid-liquid phase separation of PXN, impairing FA assembly, which in turn impedes the mechanotransduction of breast cancer cells. ULK1/2 and the well characterized PXN regulator, FAK/Src, have opposing functions on mechanotransduction and compete for phosphorylation of adjacent serine and tyrosine residues. Thus, our study reveals ULK1/2 as important regulators of PXN-dependent mechanotransduction.

The assembly of MCR is an intricate process involving the installation of a complex set of post-translational modifications and the unique Ni porphyrin cofactor F430. Despite decades of research, details of MCR assembly remain largely unresolved. Here, we report the structural characterization of MCR in two intermediate states of assembly. These intermediate states lack one or both F430 cofactors and form complexes with the previously uncharacterized McrD protein. McrD is found to bind asymmetrically to MCR, displacing large regions of the alpha subunit and increasing active site accessibility for the installation of F430--shedding light on the assembly of MCR and the role of McrD therein. This work offers crucial information for the expression of MCR in a heterologous host and provides new targets for the design of MCR inhibitors.

The origins of tissue specificity in these diseases are unclear, as the A-type Lamins are abundant and broadly expressed proteins. We show that A-type Lamin protein and transcript levels are uncorrelated across tissues. As protein-transcript discordance can be caused by variations in protein lifetime, we applied quantitative proteomics to profile protein turnover rates in healthy and progeroid tissues. We discover that tissue context and disease mutation each influence A-type Lamin protein lifetime. Lamin A/C has a weeks-long lifetime in the aorta, heart, and fat, but a days-long lifetime in tissues spared from disease. Progerin is even more long-lived than Lamin A/C in the cardiovascular system and accumulates there over time. These proteins are insoluble and densely bundled in cardiovascular tissues, which may present an energetic barrier to degradation. We reveal that human disease alleles are significantly over-represented in the long-lived proteome.

Human tumours can evolve therapy resistance by acquiring de novo genetic alterations and increased heterogeneity via mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1. Here, through parallel analysis of human clinical samples, tumour xenograft and cell line models and murine model systems, we uncover an unanticipated mechanism of therapy-induced adaptation that fuels the evolution of drug resistance. Targeted therapy directed against EGFR and ALK oncoproteins in lung cancer induced adaptations favoring apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)-mediated genome mutagenesis. In human oncogenic EGFR-driven and ALK-driven lung cancers and preclinical models, EGFR or ALK inhibitor treatment induced the expression and DNA mutagenic activity of APOBEC3B via therapy mediated activation of NF-kB signaling. Moreover, targeted therapy also mediated downregulation of certain DNA repair enzymes such as UNG2, which normally counteracts APOBEC-catalyzed DNA deamination events. In mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer mouse models, APOBEC3B was detrimental to tumour initiation and yet advantageous to tumour progression during EGFR targeted therapy, consistent with TRACERx data demonstrating subclonal enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. This study reveals how cancers adapt and drive genetic diversity in response to targeted therapy and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable clinical benefit to targeted cancer therapy.",,,biorxiv;2020.12.18.423280,4,confirmatory results,2023-02-05,02/05/2023,,Deborah R Caswell; Manasi K Mayekar; Philippe Gui; Emily K Law; Natalie I Vokes; Carlos Martinez Ruiz; Michelle Dietzen; Mihaela Angelova; Chris Bailey; Oriol Pich; Bjorn Bakker; Wei Wu; Timothy J Humpton; D.

Since echinoderms are defined by morphological novelty, even the most basic axial comparisons with their bilaterian relatives are problematic. Here, we used conserved antero-posterior (AP) axial molecular markers to determine whether the highly derived adult body plan of echinoderms masks underlying patterning similarities with other deuterostomes. To revisit this classical question, we used RNA tomography and in situ hybridizations in the sea star Patiria miniata to investigate the expression of a suite of conserved transcription factors with well-established roles in the establishment of AP polarity in bilaterians. We find that the relative spatial expression of these markers in P. miniata ambulacral ectoderm shows similarity with other deuterostomes, with the midline of each ray representing the most anterior territory and the most lateral parts exhibiting a more posterior identity. Interestingly, there is no ectodermal territory in the sea star that expresses the characteristic bilaterian trunk genetic patterning program. This suggests that from the perspective of ectoderm patterning, echinoderms are mostly head-like animals, and prompts a reinterpretation of the evolutionary trends that made echinoderms the most derived animal group.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.05.527185,1,new results,2023-02-05,02/05/2023,,Laurent Formery; Paul Peluso; Ian Kohnle; Judith Malnick; Mariya Pitel; Kevin Uhlinger; Daniel S.

However, like other optical microscopy tools, a high numerical aperture (N.A.) lens is required to generate a tight focus, generating a narrow depth of field, which necessitates dynamic focusing and limiting the imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a metasurface platform that generates multiple axial foci, which multiplies the volumetric OCT imaging speed by offering several focal planes. This platform offers accurate and flexible control over the number, positions, and intensities of axial foci generated. All-glass metasurface optical elements 8 mm in diameter are fabricated from fused-silica wafers and implemented into our scanning OCT system. With a constant lateral resolution of 1.1 μm over all depths, the multifocal OCT triples the volumetric acquisition speed for dermatological imaging, while still clearly revealing features of stratum corneum, epidermal cells, and dermal-epidermal junctions and offering morphological information as diagnostic criteria for basal cell carcinoma. The imaging speed can be further improved in a sparse sample, e.g., 7-fold with a seven-foci beam. In summary, this work demonstrates the concept of metasurface-based multifocal OCT for rapid virtual biopsy, further providing insights for developing rapid volumetric imaging systems with high resolution and compact volume.",all-glass metasurface; cellular resolution; multifocal beam; noninvasive imaging; optical coherence tomography; phase change materials; virtual biopsy,,,,,2023-02-07,2023/02/06,2023/2/7,Jingjing Zhao; Aidan Van Vleck; Yonatan Winetraub; Lin Du; Yong Han; Sumaira Aasi; Kavita Yang Sarin; Adam de la Zerda,,"Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.; Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.","Jingjing Zhao: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Aidan Van Vleck: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Yonatan Winetraub: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Lin Du: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, United States.Yong Han: Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing100084, China.Sumaira Aasi: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kavita Yang Sarin: Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.Adam de la Zerda: Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Biophysics Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Bio-X Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94158, United States.",,,,,,0

However, essentially, the role that 2DMs plays in RE has not been deeply investigated so far. Here, the RE of single-crystal films on the weakest polarity/iconicity substrate is realized to reveal its essence physical properties. Graphene facilitates attenuative charge transfer (ACT) from a substrate to epi-layer to construct remote interactions. Interfacial atoms are assembled into ""incommensurate"" epitaxial relationships through graphene to reduce misfit dislocations in the epi-layer. Moreover, graphene reduces the atomic migration barrier, leading to a tendency toward a ""layer-by-layer"" growth mode. Such film growth mode is different with the conventional epitaxy (CE), and it is beneficial for the fast growth of epi-layers and the reduction of dislocations at coalescence boundaries.

Although it is known that the floral transition of photoperiod-sensitive plants is tightly controlled by day length, how photoperiod affects their post-flowering development remains to be clearly defined, as do the underlying mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that photoperiod plays a prominent role in seed development. We found that long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) plants produce larger seeds under LD and SD conditions, respectively; however, seed size remains unchanged when CONSTANS (CO), the central regulatory gene of the photoperiodic response pathway, is mutated in Arabidopsis and soybean. We further found that CO directly represses the transcription of AP2 (a known regulatory gene of seed development) under LD conditions in Arabidopsis and SD conditions in soybean, thereby controlling seed size in a photoperiod-dependent manner, and that these effects are exerted through regulation of the proliferation of seed coat epidermal cells. Collectively, our findings reveal that a crucial regulatory cascade involving CO-AP2 modulates photoperiod-mediated seed development in plants and provide new insights into how plants with different photoperiod response types perceive seasonal changes that enable them to optimize their reproductive growth.",,,,,,2023-02-07,2023/02/06,2023/2/7,Bin Yu;
