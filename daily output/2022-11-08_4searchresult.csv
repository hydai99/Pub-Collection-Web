Here, we generated single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 424 individuals of advanced age; analyzing 1.5 million nuclear transcriptomes, we assessed the effect of genetic variants on RNA expression in cis (cis-eQTL) for 7 cell types and 81 cell subtypes. This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,138 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes. A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer pathology, accounting for the effect of APOE{varepsilon}4, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies. While eQTLs are readily detected, only a TMEM106B variant robustly affects the proportion of cell subtypes. Integration of these results with GWAS highlighted the targeted cell type and likely causal gene within susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, and educational attainment.",,,biorxiv;2022.11.07.515446,1,new results,2022-01-08,01/08/2022,,Masashi Fujita; Zongmei Gao; Lu Zeng; Cristin McCabe; Charles C White; Bernard Ng; Gilad Sahar Green; Orit Rozenblatt-Rosen; Devan Phillips; Liat Amir-Zilberstein; Hyo Lee; Richard V Pearse; Atlas Khan; Badri N Vardarajan; Krzysztof Kiryluk; Chun Jimmie Ye; Hans-Ulrich Klein; Gao Wang; Aviv Regev; Naomi Habib; Julie A Schneider; Yanling Wang; Tracy Young-Pearse; Sara Mostafavi; David A Bennett; Vilas Menon; Phillip L De Jager,"Fujita, M.; Gao, Z.; Zeng, L.; McCabe, C.; White, C.

We observed lower FcRγ protein expression in NK cell subsets from lung transplant patients during rapamycin treatment, suggesting a link with reduced mTOR activity. Further, FcRγ-/low NK cell subsets from healthy donors displayed reduced mTOR activity. We discovered that FcRγ upregulation is dependent on cell proliferation progression mediated by IL-2, IL-15, or IL-12, is sensitive to mTOR suppression, and is inhibited by TGFβ or IFNα. Accordingly, the accumulation of adaptive-like FcRγ-/low NK cells in COVID-19 patients corresponded to increased TGFβ and IFNα levels and disease severity. Our results show that an adaptive-like NK cell phenotype is induced by diminished cell proliferation and has an early prognostic value for increased TGFβ and IFNα levels in COVID-19 infection associated with disease severity.",,,,,,2022-09-07,2022/09/06,2022/9/7,Avishai Shemesh ; Yapeng Su ; Daniel R Calabrese ; Daniel Chen ; Janice Arakawa-Hoyt ; Kole T Roybal ; James R Heath ; John R Greenland ; Lewis L Lanier,,"Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.; Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.; University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.;Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.;Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.;Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; Department of Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.","Avishai Shemesh: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.Yapeng Su: Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.Daniel R Calabrese: Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.; Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.Daniel Chen: Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.; Department of Informatics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Janice Arakawa-Hoyt: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.Kole T Roybal: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.; University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.James R Heath: Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.John R Greenland: Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA.; Medical Service, Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.Lewis L Lanier: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.",,,,,,0

We define a range of laser excitation settings for which there was no significant change in mouse Neuro2A cells after laser exposure.

In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al., 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.",cell biology ; chromosome segregation ; coarse-grained modeling ; mechanics ; microtubules ; p. tridactylis ; physics of living systems ; spindle,,,,,2022-11-09,2022/11/08,2022/11/9,Pooja Suresh ; Vahe Galstyan ; Rob Phillips ; Sophie Dumont,,,,,,,,,0
