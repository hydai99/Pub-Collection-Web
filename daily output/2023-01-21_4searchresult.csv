However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, this work provides a simplified purification scheme for ferritin-based vaccines.",,,,,,2022-08-13,2022/08/12,2022/8/13,Payton Weidenbacher; Sriharshita Musunuri; Abigail E Powell; Shaogeng Tang; Jonathan Do; Mrinmoy Sanyal; Peter S Kim,,"Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.","Payton Weidenbacher: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Sriharshita Musunuri: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Abigail E Powell: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Shaogeng Tang: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Jonathan Do: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Mrinmoy Sanyal: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.Peter S Kim: Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.",,,,,,0

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

However, surveillance mechanisms that specifically respond to stalled ribosomes with an occluded A site have not been identified. We discovered that the elongation factor-1α (eEF1A) inhibitor, ternatin-4, triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of eEF1A on stalled ribosomes. Using a chemical genetic approach, we unveiled a signaling network comprising two E3 ligases, RNF14 and RNF25, which are required for eEF1A degradation. Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role by engaging RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates eEF1A. The site-specific, RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein RPS27A/eS31 provides a second essential signaling input.

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.

Statement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.

We investigated whether plasma metabolites differed amongst patients with LCA-derived hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory ARDS, and tested the prognostic utility of adding metabolic clusters to LCA phenotypes. We analyzed data from 93 ARDS patients with sepsis enrolled in a multi-center prospective cohort of critically ill patients, comparing 970 metabolites between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. 188 metabolites were differentially abundant between the two LCA-derived phenotypes. After adjusting for age, sex, confounding medications, and comorbid liver and kidney disease, 82 metabolites remained significantly different. Hyperinflammatory ARDS patients had reduced circulating lipids but high levels of pyruvate, lactate, and malate. Metabolic cluster and LCA-derived phenotypes were each significantly and independently associated with survival. Hyperinflammatory ARDS patients may be experiencing a glycolytic shift leading to dysregulated lipid metabolism.

Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts. Our pipeline of genome-wide association studies with disease liabilities can be applied to other biobanks with rich phenotype and genotype data.",,,medrxiv;2023.01.18.23284383,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2023-01-19,01/19/2023,,Lu Yang; Marie C.

Adaptation to a genetically homogeneous host population should theoretically result in specialization, while adaptation to an evolving host population (i.e., coevolution) can result in various outcomes including diversification, range expansion, and/or local adaptation. For viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages), our understanding of how evolutionary history of the bacterial host(s) impacts viral genotypic and phenotypic evolution is currently limited. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and two different metrics of phage impacts to compare the genotypes and phenotypes of lytic phages that had either coevolved with or were repeatedly passaged on an unchanging (ancestral) strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Genomes of coevolved phages had more mutations than those of phages passaged on a constant host, and most mutations were in genes encoding phage tail-associated proteins. Phages from both passaging treatments shared some phenotypic outcomes, including range expansion and divergence across replicate populations, but coevolved phages were more efficient at reducing population growth (particularly of sympatric coevolved hosts). Genotypic similarity correlated with infectivity profile similarity in coevolved phages, but not in phages passaged on the ancestral host. Overall, while adaptation to either host type (coevolving or ancestral) led to divergence in phage tail proteins and infectivity patterns, coevolution led to more rapid molecular changes that increased bacterial killing efficiency and had more predictable effects on infectivity range. Together, these results underscore the important role of hosts in driving viral evolution and in shaping the genotype-phenotype relationship.",bacteriophage evolution; evolutionary history; experimental evolution; genotype-phenotype relationship; plant pathogen,,,,,2023-01-19,2023/01/18,2023/1/19,Catherine A Hernandez; Véronique A Delesalle; Greg Krukonis; Jenna DeCurzio; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.; Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Catherine A Hernandez: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Véronique A Delesalle: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Greg Krukonis: Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.Jenna DeCurzio: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,,,,0

Here, we image dopamine modulation in striatal brain tissue slices with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCat) and implement machine learning to determine which features of dopamine modulation are unique to changes in stimulation strength, and to different neuroanatomical regions. We trained a support vector machine and a random forest classifier to determine whether recordings were made from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) versus the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and find that machine learning is able to accurately distinguish dopamine release that occurs in DLS from that occurring in DMS in a manner unachievable with canonical statistical analysis. Furthermore, our analysis determines that dopamine modulatory signals including the number of unique dopamine release sites and peak dopamine released per stimulation event are most predictive of neuroanatomy yet note that integrated neuromodulator amount is the conventional metric currently used to monitor neuromodulation in animal studies. Lastly, our study finds that machine learning discrimination of different stimulation strengths or neuroanatomical regions is only possible in adult animals, suggesting a high degree of variability in dopamine modulatory kinetics during animal development.

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway.

Omicron could hardly be neutralized by sera of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents infected with the Delta variant. Through mass spectrometry on MHC-bound peptidomes, we found that the spike protein of the Omicron variants could generate additional CD8 + T cell epitopes, compared with Delta. These epitopes could induce robust CD8 + T cell responses. Moreover, we found booster vaccination increased the cross-memory CD8 + T cell responses against Omicron. Metabolic regulome analysis of Omicron-specific T cell showed a metabolic profile that promoted the response of memory T cells. Consistently, a greater fraction of memory CD8 + T cells existed in Omicron stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, CD147 was also a receptor for the Omicron variants, and CD147 antibody inhibited infection of Omicron. CD147-mediated Omicron infection in a human CD147 transgenic mouse model induced exudative alveolar pneumonia. Taken together, our data suggested that vaccination booster and receptor blocking antibody are two effective strategies against Omicron.",,,,,,2023-01-22,2023/01/21,2023/1/22,Jiejie Geng; Xu Yang; Kun

The aim of this study was to determine how migration influences two ecological currencies, energy expenditure and time allocated towards different behaviors, in a full annual cycle context. We compare these currencies among lesser black-backed gulls that range from short- (< 250 km) to long-distance (> 4500 km) migrants. Daily time-activity budgets were reconstructed from tri-axial acceleration and GPS, which, in conjunction with a bioenergetics model to estimate thermoregulatory costs, enabled us to estimate daily energy expenditure throughout the year. We found that migration strategy had no effect on annual energy expenditure, however, energy expenditure through time deviated more from the annual average as migration distance increased. Patterns in time-activity budgets were similar across strategies, suggesting migration strategy does not limit behavioral adjustments required for other annual cycle stages (breeding, molt, wintering). Variation among individuals using the same strategy was high, suggesting that daily behavioral decisions (e.g. foraging strategy) contribute more towards energy expenditure than an individual's migration strategy. These findings provide unprecedented new understanding regarding the relative importance of fine versus broad-scale behavioral strategies towards annual energy expenditures.",,,,,,2023-01-22,2023/01/21,2023/1/22,J Morgan Brown; Willem Bouten; Kees C J Camphuysen; Bart A Nolet; Judy Shamoun-Baranes,,"Department of Coastal Systems, NIOZ Royal Institute for Sea Research, Texel, The Netherlands.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jmbrown@wcs.org.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, Wageningen, The Netherlands.","J Morgan Brown: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jmbrown@wcs.org.Willem Bouten: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.Kees C J Camphuysen: Department of Coastal Systems, NIOZ Royal Institute for Sea Research, Texel, The Netherlands.Bart A Nolet: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, Wageningen, The Netherlands.Judy Shamoun-Baranes: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",,,,,,0
