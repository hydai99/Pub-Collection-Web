Cate,"University of California, Berkeley",bioRxiv,10.1101/2023.01.25.525534,,Aminobenzoic acid derivatives obstruct induced fit in the catalytic center of the ribosome,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.25.525534v1,"The Escherichia coli ribosome can incorporate a variety of non-O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acid monomers into polypeptide chains, but with poor efficiency. Although these monomers span a diverse set of compounds, there exists no high-resolution structural information regarding their positioning within the catalytic center of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Thus, details regarding the mechanism of amide bond formation and the structural basis for differences and defects in incorporation efficiency remain unknown. Within a set of three aminobenzoic acid derivatives-3-aminopyridine-4-carboxylic acid (Apy), ortho-aminobenzoic acid (oABZ), and meta-aminobenzoic acid (mABZ)-the ribosome incorporates Apy into polypeptide chains with the highest efficiency, followed by oABZ and then mABZ, a trend that does not track with the nucleophilicity of the reactive amines. Here, we report high resolution cryo-EM structures of the ribosome with these three aminobenzoic acid derivatives charged on tRNA bound in the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site). These structures reveal how the aromatic ring of each monomer sterically blocks positioning of nucleotide U2506, thereby preventing rearrangement of nucleotide U2585 and the resulting induced fit in the PTC required for efficient amide bond formation. They also reveal disruptions to the ""proton wire"" responsible for facilitating formation and breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Together, the cryo-EM structures reported here provide a clear rationale for differences in reactivity of aminobenzoic acid derivatives relative to O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW--amino acids and each other, and point to stereochemical constraints on the size and geometry of non-proteinogenic monomers that can be accepted efficiently by wild-type ribosomes.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.25.525534,1,new results,2023-01-26,01/26/2023,,Chandrima Majumdar; Joshua A.

However, the dynamics of this process are difficult to characterize in dominant gut species in their complex in vivo environment. Here we show that the fine-scale dynamics of genome-wide transposon libraries can enable quantitative inferences of these in vivo evolutionary forces. By analyzing >400,000 lineages across four human Bacteroides strains in gnotobiotic mice, we observed positive selection on thousands of previously hidden mutations -- most of which were unrelated to their original gene knockouts. The spectrum of fitness benefits varied between species, and displayed diverse tradeoffs over time and in different dietary conditions, enabling inferences of their underlying function. These results suggest that within-host adaptations arise from an intense competition between numerous contending mutations, which can strongly influence their emergent evolutionary tradeoffs.",,,biorxiv;2022.05.13.491573,2,new results,2023-01-27,01/27/2023,,Daniel P.G.H.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the expression of marker proteins of CAFs in PTC and their correlations with clinicopathological features through immunohistochemistry. The medical records of 125 PTC patients were reviewed in this study, whose specimens were retrieved for immunohistochemistry. Four CAFs marker proteins, FAP fibroblast activated protein (FAP), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Vimentin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α(PDGFR-α), were stained and scored. Then, statistical analyses were performed. The immunoreactivity scores of FAP and α-SMA correlated with tumor size, BRAF mutation, extrathyroidal, invasion, pathological subtype, lymph node metastasis and ATA risk stratification. Moreover, binary logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves showed that high FAP and α-SMA immunoreactivity scores were risk factors for extrathyroidal invasion, BRAF mutation, multi-focality and lymph node metastasis (especially N1b) with good sensitivity and accuracy in prediction. A better performance was found in FAP than α-SMA. Strong expressions of CAFs were risk factors for worse thyroid cancer clinicopathological features.
