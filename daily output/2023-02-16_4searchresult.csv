Many tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a database of sequences from many species before calling variants. In this synthesis, we investigate how databases of increasingly diverse and closely related species have pushed the limits of current alignment algorithms, thereby degrading the performance of metagenotyping tools. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a trade-off between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods showing promise to further improve metagenotyping in response to the rapid growth in genome collections.

Phosphopeptides presented in complex with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) have been reported to provide a stability advantage over their unmodified counterparts when presented by the common HLA allele A*02:01. This stability in turn is thought to translate to enhanced immunogenicity. Whether tumor-associated phosphopeptides presented by other common alleles exhibit immunogenicity and structural characteristics similar to those presented by A*02:01 is unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine the identity, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides presented by the common alleles HLA-A*03:01, -A*11:01, -C*07:01, and -C*07:02.

MethodsWe isolated peptide-MHC complexes by immunoprecipitation of 10 healthy and neoplastic tissue samples using mass spectrometry, and then combined the resulting data with public immunopeptidomics datasets to assemble a curated set of phosphopeptides presented by 20 distinct healthy and neoplastic tissue types. We determined the biochemical features of selected phosphopeptides by in vitro binding assays and in silico docking, and their immunogenicity by analyzing healthy donor T cells for phosphopeptide-specific multimer binding and cytokine production.

ResultsWe demonstrated that HLA-A*03:01 and -A*11:01 present shared phosphopeptides on multiple tumor types, particularly lymphomas and leukemias; a subset of these peptides were not found on healthy tissues. These phosphopeptides generally exhibited similar binding to A*11:01 and similar or worse binding to A*03:01 than their unmodified counterparts. Additionally, we found that HLA-C*07:01 phosphopeptides were generally presented in the absence of their unmodified counterparts, and were dependent on B-pocket interactions that were absent in C*07:02, but such interactions were still permissive to unmodified peptide binding. We found that HLA-A*02:01 and -A*11:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cells could be readily detected in an autologous setting, even when the wildtype peptide was co-presented. In contrast, HLA-A*03:01 or -C*07:01 phosphopeptide-specific T cell responses were not elicited in autologous donors, but could be elicited in allogeneic donors.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that phosphopeptides across multiple alleles represent shared tumor-specific antigens that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapy, but the immunogenicity of such phosphopeptides is not a general feature, which may be explained by a lack of increase in energetic favorability associated with phosphopeptide binding to A*03:01. Thus, to address an expanded patient population, phosphopeptide-targeted immunotherapies should be wary of allele-specific differences.

O_LIWhat is already known on this topic - Phosphorylated peptides presented by the common HLA alleles A*02:01 and B*07:02 are differentially expressed by multiple tumor types, exhibit structural fitness due to phosphorylation, and are targets of healthy donor T cell surveillance, but it is not clear, however, whether such features apply to phosphopeptides presented by other common HLA alleles.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds - We investigated the tumor presentation, binding, structural features, and immunogenicity of phosphopeptides to the prevalent alleles A*03:01, A*11:01, C*07:01, and C*07:02, selected on the basis of their presentation by malignant cells but not normal cells, finding tumor antigens derived from genetic dependencies in lymphomas and leukemias that bind HLA-A3, -A11, -C7 molecules. While we could detect circulating T cell responses in healthy individuals to A*2:01 and A*11:01 phosphopeptides, we did not find such responses to A*03:01 or C*07:01 phosphopeptides, except when utilizing allogeneic donor T cells, indicating that these phosphopeptides may not be immunogenic in an autologous setting but can still be targeted by other means.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - An expanded patient population expressing alleles other than A*02:01 can be addressed through the development of immunotherapies specific for phosphopeptides profiled in the present work, provided the nuances we describe between alleles are taken into consideration.

Numerous CNVs across the Plasmodium falciparum genome contribute directly to drug resistance or impact fitness of this protozoan parasite. CNVs that encompass the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) gene confer resistance to antimalarials that target this enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (i.e. DSM1). During the characterization of DSM1 resistant parasite lines with DHODH CNVs, we detected selection of an additional CNV that encompasses 3 genes (~5 kb) including GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1 amplicon). While this locus has been implicated in increased fitness of antifolate resistant parasites, GCH1 CNVs had not previously been reported to contribute to resistance to other antimalarials. Here, we further explored the association between GCH1 and DHODH copy number. We visualized single long reads and directly quantified the number of tandem GCH1 amplicons in a parental line versus a DSM1-selected line. We found that the GCH1 amplicons share a consistent structure in all lines. However, we detected more reads that encompassed a higher number of amplicons in the resistant (up to 7 amplicons) compared to the parental line (3 amplicons). To better understand the implications of this result, we evaluated variation at this locus across multiple short- and long-read data sets collected from various parasite lines. Based on our analysis of parasites resistant to other DHODH inhibitors (DSM265, DSM267, and DSM705), GCH1 is not likely contributing directly to resistance; however, higher numbers of the GCH1 amplicon are associated with increased DHODH copies and may compensate for changes in metabolism of parasites. This is supported by the direct connection between folate and pyrimidine metabolism, which together contribute to nucleic acid biosynthesis. This study highlights the importance of studying clonal variation and potential biochemical connections as novel antimalarials move closer to clinical approval.",,,biorxiv;2023.02.13.528367,1,new results,2023-02-13,02/13/2023,,Shiwei Liu; Emily R.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, unlike most eukaryotes, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that Haloferax chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

Quasi-experimental evidence on non-specific effects from 39 Swedish birth cohorts,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2023/02/16/2023.02.16.23286013,"The Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) is widely used globally. Many high-income countries discontinued nationwide vaccination policies as the TB prevalence decreased. However, there is continued interest in whether the general childhood immunity boost conferred by the BCG vaccination impacts adult health and mortality in low-TB contexts (known as non-specific effects) and whether BCG vaccination should be continued as a population policy. While recent studies found evidence of an association between BCG vaccination and later-life survival, it is unclear whether these associations are causal or driven by unobserved characteristics of those who chose to voluntarily vaccinate. We use the abrupt discontinuation of mandatory BCG vaccination in Sweden in 1975 as a natural experiment to estimate the causal non-specific effect of the BCG vaccine on long-term cohort survival. Applying two complementary study designs, we find no evidence that survival to age 30 was affected by the discontinuation of childhood BCG vaccination. The results are consistent in the male and female subpopulations and are robust to several sensitivity and falsification tests. Overall, despite interest and prior correlational studies suggesting large non-specific effects, we do not find any population-level evidence for a non-specific effect of the BCG vaccine discontinuation on long term survival in Sweden.",,,medrxiv;2023.02.16.23286013,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2023-02-16,02/16/2023,,Michaela Theilmann; Pascal Geldsetzer; Till Baernighausen; Nikkil Sudharsanan,"Theilmann, M.; Geldsetzer, P.; Baernighausen, T.; Sudharsanan, N.","Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany;; Stanford University;; University of Heidelberg;; Technical University of Munich","Michaela Theilmann, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany;], [Pascal Geldsetzer, Stanford University;], [Till Baernighausen, University of Heidelberg;], [Nikkil Sudharsanan, Technical University of Munich",NA,,,,,0

A total of 1263 TUR cancer survivors aged 20 to 85 years old were investigated using data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 1999-2018. The primary outcome was the NLR, which was defined as having two levels: high-risk (≥ 3) and low-risk (< 3). The association between smoking cessation time and a high-risk NLR level was analyzed using weighted logistic regression models. Overall, the current smoking rate of TUR cancer survivors was found to be 21.7%. Older age (75 years above), gender and respiratory-related cancers are covariables associated with high risk of NLR levels for individual who identified as Non-Hispanic White (NHW). Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) (n = 27) who quit smoking after a cancer diagnosis were associated with the highest risk of a high NLR (OR 4.83, 95% CI 1.40-16.61, p = 0.01) compared to NHB nonsmokers (n = 139). These findings suggest that the risk of a high NLR level is strongly associated with the time of smoking cessation in NHB TUR cancer survivors. As a result, NHB TUR cancer survivors should quit smoking as soon as possible because the benefits of quitting smoking were observed over the 5 year period following smoking cessation.",,,,,,2023-02-17,2023/02/16,2023/2/17,You Lu; Katherine Kwong; James Wells; Andrea Edwards; Zhong Chen; Tung-Sung Tseng; Kun Zhang,,"Behavioral and Community Health Science, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Science Center, 2020 Gravier Street, Room 213, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA. ttseng@lsuhsc.edu.; Department of Human Development, Connecticut College, New London, CT, USA.; Department of Physics and Computer Science, Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA.; Department of Physics and Computer Science, Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA. kzhang@xula.edu.; Bioniformatics Core of Xavier NIH RCMI Center of Cancer Research, Xavier University of Louisiana, 1 Drexel Drive, 540 NCF Annex, New Orleans, LA, 70125, USA. kzhang@xula.edu.; Department of Physiology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA.","You Lu: Department of Physics and Computer Science, Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA.Katherine Kwong: Department of Human Development, Connecticut College, New London, CT, USA.James Wells: Department of Physiology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA.Andrea Edwards: Department of Physics and Computer Science, Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA.Zhong Chen: Department of Physics and Computer Science, Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA.Tung-Sung Tseng: Behavioral and Community Health Science, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Science Center, 2020 Gravier Street, Room 213, New Orleans, LA, 70112, USA. ttseng@lsuhsc.edu.Kun Zhang: Department of Physics and Computer Science, Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA. kzhang@xula.edu.; Bioniformatics Core of Xavier NIH RCMI Center of Cancer Research, Xavier University of Louisiana, 1 Drexel Drive, 540 NCF Annex, New Orleans, LA, 70125, USA. kzhang@xula.edu.",,,,,,0

Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) previously described target the native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Envelope (Env), but the relevance of the tiered categories for inhibitors targeting another Env conformation, the prehairpin intermediate, is not well understood. Here, we show that two inhibitors targeting distinct highly conserved regions of the prehairpin intermediate have strikingly consistent neutralization potencies (within ~100-fold for a given inhibitor) against strains in all three neutralization tiers of HIV-1; in contrast, best-in-class bnAbs targeting diverse Env epitopes vary by more than 10,000-fold in potency against these strains. Our results indicate that antisera-based HIV-1 neutralization tiers are not relevant for inhibitors targeting the prehairpin intermediate and highlight the potential for therapies and vaccine efforts targeting this conformation.",5-Helix; HIV-1; prehairpin intermediate; tier-2 virus; tier-3 virus,,,,,2023-02-17,2023/02/16,2023/2/17,Benjamin N Bell; Theodora U J Bruun; Natalia Friedland; Peter S Kim,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.","Benjamin N Bell: Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Theodora U J Bruun: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.Natalia Friedland: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.Peter S Kim: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.",,,,,,0
