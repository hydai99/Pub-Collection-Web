Evidence on CVD risk factor prevalence among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty globally is sparse because studies have used measures of socioeconomic status that are not comparable across study populations and countries. For adults living in extreme poverty, this study aimed to determine i) the prevalence of each of five key CVD risk factors, ii) how the prevalence of these CVD risk factors varies across and within countries, and iii) the level of treatment coverage with statin, antihypertensive, and diabetes therapy.

MethodsWe pooled individual-level data from 105 nationally representative household surveys with physical measurements of hypertension, diabetes, overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as self-reported smoking status, from 78 countries that represent 85% of people living in extreme poverty globally. Those living in extreme poverty were defined by ordering participants according to a continuous household wealth index or household income value, and then applying World Bank estimates on the proportion of each countrys population that is living in extreme poverty. We used modified Poisson regression models to examine how CVD risk factor prevalence among those in extreme poverty varied by age, sex, educational attainment, and rural versus urban residency. We also calculated the proportion of participants with diabetes or hypertension who self-reported the use of blood pressure- or blood glucose-lowering medication, respectively; the proportion with hypertension who achieved blood pressure control; and the proportion recommended for statin use according to WHO guidelines who reported taking a statin.

ResultsOf 32,695,579 participants, 7,922,289 were living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), 15,986,099 on less than $3.20/day, and 23,466,879 on less than $5.50/day. Among those living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), the age-standardized prevalence was 17.5% (95% CI: 16.7% - 18.3%) for hypertension, 4.0% (95% CI: 3.6% - 4.5%) for diabetes, 10.6% (95% CI: 9.0% - 12.3%) for current smoking, 3.1% (95% CI: 2.8% - 3.3%) for obesity, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9% - 1.9%) for dyslipidemia. In most countries in our analysis, the prevalence of these risk factors among those living in extreme poverty was not notably lower than in the total population. Hypertension treatment and control, diabetes treatment, and statin use were low across all poverty levels in low-income countries, while in lower and upper middle-income countries individuals living at more extreme levels of poverty had a lower probability of reporting the use of these medications and achieving hypertension control.

ConclusionsWe found a high prevalence of CVD risk factors among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty, along with low statin use and low treatment rates for diabetes and hypertension. Our detailed analysis and comparison across poverty levels could inform equity discussions for resource allocation and the design of effective interventions.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280861,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/10/2022,01/10/2022,,Pascal Geldsetzer; Rebecca L.

Using proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, we identified Numb as a new ciliary protein that positively regulates Hh signaling. Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket and acts as an endocytic adaptor to incorporate Ptch1 into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby promoting Ptch1 exit from the cilium, a key step in Hh signaling activation. Numb loss impaired Sonic Hedgehog-induced Ptch1 departure from the cilium, resulting in severe attenuation of Hh signaling. Genetic ablation of Numb and its homolog Numblike in the developing cerebellum impaired the proliferation of granule cell precursors, a Hh-dependent process, resulting in reduced cerebellar size. This study demonstrates a key function of Numb in controlling protein levels in the cilium, and highlights Numbs critical role in the regulation of Hh signaling.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.10.511655,3,new results,01/11/2022,01/11/2022,,Xiaoliang Liu; Patricia T.

We term this strategy, integrating cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) with glycoprotein surface capture, ""structural surfaceomics"". As a proof of principle, we apply this technology to acute myeloid leukemia, a hematologic malignancy with dismal outcomes and no known optimal immunotherapy target. We identify the activated conformation of integrin-{beta}2 as a structurally-defined, widely-expressed, AML-specific target. We develop and characterize recombinant antibodies to this protein conformation, and show that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells eliminate AML cells and patient-derived xenografts without notable toxicity versus normal hematopoietic cells.

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo. In the future, TRAIL can be used to explore how environment, aging, and disease affect tissue homeostasis.",,,biorxiv;2022.04.24.488979,3,new results,01/12/2022,01/12/2022,,John Hasper; Kevin Welle; Jennifer Hryhorenko; Sina Ghaemmaghami; Abigail Buchwalter,"Hasper, J.; Welle, K.

Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 15 human organ donors, 20 tissues, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the healthy human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution. In order to construct this atlas, we developed a computational pipeline which identifies high-confidence microbial sequences from three domains of life within the sea of human transcripts in individual cells, and show that this is a non-trivial search for one in a million sequences. Together with data from a separate validation cohort of 8 additional donors, we identify more than a thousand diverse bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. In characterizing the human tissue microbiome, we demonstrate that individuals harbor unique species associated not just with each tissue but often with particular cell types, and that many of these species remain uncharacterized. Moreover, combining our data with the Human Microbiome Project, the tumor microbiome dataset by Nejman et al., and the PATRIC database, we map the likely microbial flow routes from external-facing microbiomes to internal tissues and tumors, and show the existence of many unexpected routes taken by both commensals and pathogens. We find that [~]30% of bacterial species found in tumors are detectable across healthy tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from healthy tissues, even those from distant sites. Increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantify the microbial load and diversity across different cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells.

We used sensitivity analyses and bias analyses to explore such discrepancies in a study of the indirect effects of influenza vaccination.

MethodsWe fit an age-structured, deterministic, compartmental model to estimate indirect effects of a school-based influenza vaccination program in California that was evaluated in a previous matched cohort study. To understand discrepancies in their results, we used 1) a model with constrained parameters such that projections matched the cohort study; and 2) probabilistic bias analyses to identify potential biases (e.g., outcome misclassification due to incomplete influenza testing) that, if corrected, would align the empirical results with the mathematical model.

ResultsThe indirect effect estimate (% reduction in influenza hospitalization among older adults in intervention vs. control) was 22.3% (95% CI 7.6% - 37.1%) in the cohort study but only 1.6% (95% Bayesian credible intervals 0.4 - 4.4%) in the mathematical model. When constrained, mathematical models aligned with the cohort study when there was substantially lower pre-existing immunity among school-age children and older adults. Conversely, empirical estimates corrected for potential bias aligned with mathematical model estimates only if influenza testing rates were 15-23% lower in the intervention vs. comparison site.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

Neural networkscan assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manualannotations, while unsupervised approaches have fared poorly in ultrasound todate. Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labelsrequired) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinicaldomain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements. We also tested our pipeline againstexternal images from an additional 10,030 patients (20,060 images) withavailable manual tracings of the left ventricle. Results: r2 between clinicallymeasured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reportedinter-clinician variation for LVESV and LVEDV (pipeline vs. clinical r2= 0.74and r2=0.65, respectively), LVEF and LV mass (r2= 0.46 and r2=0.54), left andright atrium volumes (r2=0.7 and r2=0.6), and right ventricle area (r2=0.47).When binarized into normal vs. abnormal categories, average accuracy was 0.81(range 0.71-0.95). A subset of the test echocardiograms (n=553) hadcorresponding cardiac MRI; correlation between pipeline and CMR measurementswas similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and CMR. Finally, in theexternal dataset, our pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with anaverage Dice score of 0.83 (95% CI 0.83).

We found that using acontext-preserving cut-paste strategy, we could create valid training data asmeasured by performance of the resulting trained model on the benchmark testdataset.
