While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",,,biorxiv;2021.07.01.450475,2,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,Chengkun Wang; Ravi K.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in agin, but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell specific Hmgcl deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that during aging, liver derived circulating ketone bodies might be more important for deactivating NLRP3 inflammasome and controlling organismal metabolism.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.14.512312,2,new results,01/16/2022,01/16/2022,,Emily L.

One of the most important phenotypes that differs between cells is their size, which was recently shown to be an important determinant of proteome composition in populations of similarly sized cells. We therefore sought to test if the effects of cell size on protein concentrations were also evident in single cell proteomics data. Using the relative concentrations of histone proteins to estimate a cells DNA-to-cell volume ratio, we found that cell size correlated with the cell-to-cell variance in two single cell proteome datasets, each acquired using different preparation and measurement platforms. Moreover, the proteome differences between small and large single cells significantly correlated with how cell size affects the proteomes of cultured cells measured in bulk. We therefore conclude that cell size accounts for a substantial amount of proteome heterogeneity in single cells and should be considered particularly when comparing cells of a similar type.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.17.512548,1,new results,01/17/2022,01/17/2022,,Michael C.

To investigate the interaction between aging and microglial circadian rhythmicity, we examined mice deficient in the core clock transcription factor, BMAL1. Aging Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline in association with suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation and increases in immature dendritic spines. C1q deposition at synapses and synaptic engulfment were significantly decreased in aging Bmal1-deficient microglia, suggesting that BMAL1 plays a role in regulating synaptic pruning in aging. In addition to accelerated age-associated hippocampal deficits, Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice also showed deficits in the sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness across light and dark phases.

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Our data point to roles for both systemic factors acting on lung endothelial cells and viral infection of endothelial cells in COVID-19-associated endotheliopathy.",COVID-19 ; acute respiratory distress syndrome ; endothelial permeability ; lung endothelial injury,,,,,2022/6/2/6/0,,2022/6/2/6/0,"Jérémie Joffre ; Lauren Rodriguez ; Zachary A Matthay ; Elliot Lloyd ; Alexander T Fields ; Roland J Bainton ; Philip Kurien ; Anita Sil ; Carolyn S Calfee ; Prescott G Woodruff ; David J Erle ; Carolyn Hendrickson ; Matthew F Krummel ; Charles R Langelier ; Michael A Matthay ; Lucy Z Kornblith ; Judith Hellman ; COVID-19 Multi-Phenotyping for Effective Therapies (COMET) Consortium ; COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy, Inflammation, and Thrombosis (Co-ACIT) Study Group",,";CoLabs.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.;Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.;Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.; CoLabs.;Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.;Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California.;Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.;Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.;ImmunoX Initiative.; Department of Pathology.","Jérémie Joffre: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Lauren Rodriguez: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.; CoLabs.Zachary A Matthay: Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.Elliot Lloyd: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Alexander T Fields: Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.Roland J Bainton: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Philip Kurien: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.Anita Sil: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine.Carolyn S Calfee: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.Prescott G Woodruff: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.David J Erle: CoLabs.; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.; ImmunoX Initiative.Carolyn Hendrickson: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.Matthew F Krummel: ImmunoX Initiative.; Department of Pathology.Charles R Langelier: Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California; and.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California.Michael A Matthay: Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.; Cardiovascular Research Institute.Lucy Z Kornblith: Division of General Surgery, Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.Judith Hellman: Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine.COVID-19 Multi-Phenotyping for Effective Therapies (COMET) Consortium: COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy, Inflammation, and Thrombosis (Co-ACIT) Study Group: ",,,,,,0
