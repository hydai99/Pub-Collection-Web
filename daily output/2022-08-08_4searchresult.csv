We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

Mouse cytomegalovirus infection triggers NK receptor-induced, ligand-specific IL-12-dependent NK cell expansion, yet specific IL-12 stimulation ex vivo leading to NK cell proliferation and expansion is not established. Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion. These findings demonstrate that activating NK receptor stimulation promotes differential IL-12 signaling, leading to human NK cell expansion, and suggest adopting strategies to provide IL-12 signaling in vivo for ligand-specific IL-2-primed NK cell-based therapies.",35758909,10.1084/jem.20212434.,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20212434,,06/27/2022,08/01/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.2 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA.3 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.4 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.6 Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.7 University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.",,,2022 Aug 1;219(8):e20212434.,0,,

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",35817986,10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y,,07/11/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.6 Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.9 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.10 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.11 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.12 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.13 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.14 Diabetes Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.15 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.16 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.17 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.18 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Aug;54(8):1133-1144.,0,,

A systematic understanding of host factors influencing viral infection is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in murine models. These mucins also inhibit infection of diverse respiratory viruses. This functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors provides a physiologically relevant starting point for new host-directed therapeutics and highlights airway mucins as a host defense mechanism.",35879412,10.1038/s41588-022-01131-x.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9355872/,,07/25/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.5 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.6 Marsico Lung Institute and Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.8 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.9 Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.10 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.11 Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.12 Department of Chemistry and Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.13 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.14 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.15 Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.16 The Henry Wheeler Center for Emerging and Neglected Diseases, Berkeley, CA, USA.17 Department of Genetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.18 Department of Regenerative and Cancer Cell Biology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA.19 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.20 Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.21 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.22 Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.23 Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. eharris@berkeley.edu.24 Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. silvanak@stanford.edu.25 Arc Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA. silvanak@stanford.edu.26 Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.27 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.28 Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.29 Arc Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA. pdhsu@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Aug;54(8):1078-1089.,0,,

Here we present cytoself, a deep-learning approach for fully self-supervised protein localization profiling and clustering. Cytoself leverages a self-supervised training scheme that does not require preexisting knowledge, categories or annotations. Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches. Moreover, to better understand the inner workings of our model, we dissect the emergent features from which our clustering is derived, interpret them in the context of the fluorescence images, and analyze the performance contributions of each component of our approach.",35879608,10.1038/s41592-022-01541-z.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9349041/,,07/25/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hirofumi.kobayashi@czbiohub.org.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. manuel.leonetti@czbiohub.org.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. loic.royer@czbiohub.org.",,,2022 Aug;19(8):995-1003.,0,,

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease.",35896747,10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4,,07/27/2022,08/2022,2022-08-01,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.5 Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.",,,2022 Aug;608(7921):161-167.,0,,

Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.              Methods:                    Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.              Results:                    Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.              Interpretation:                    Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels.

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation. Our findings reveal β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells implying a role of S1P1 signaling in remyelination.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.Methods The gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.Results Variation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.Conclusions The observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502150,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502150v1,2022.07.30.502150,08/02/2022,,2022-08-02,"Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine","Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine",,,0,,

Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat.

To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502752,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502752v1,2022.08.04.502752,08/05/2022,,2022-08-05,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University","Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Chemistry, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging",,,0,,

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs. This study introduces a new robust tool for studying mammalian transcriptional regulation and demonstrates the power of optogenetic tools in dissecting the quantitative features of important cellular pathways.",,10.1101/2022.08.03.502739,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.03.502739v1,2022.08.03.502739,08/05/2022,,2022-08-05,"Altos Labs, Redwood City, CA; Cell Design Initiative, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Present Address: BigHat Biosciences, San Mateo, CA; Present Address: Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Development and Cell Biology, Rockefeller University, NY","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Present Address: BigHat Biosciences, San Mateo, CA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Present Address: Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Development and Cell Biology, Rockefeller University, NY; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Altos Labs, Redwood City, CA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; Cell Design Initiative, UCSF, San Francisco, CA; Altos Labs, Redwood City, CA",,,0,,

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers. These intermediate EMP markers correlated with worse patient outcomes and could serve as potential new therapeutic targets to block metastatic development.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502697,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502697v1,2022.08.04.502697,08/05/2022,,2022-08-05,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco; Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA","Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco; Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA",,,0,,

Although much has been learned about their physiology and their Madagascar ecology and phylogeny, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell type evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell profiles to those of the homologous cells in human and mouse. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate cell specialization even within a single tissue compartment, as well as many cell types for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse.

Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy. In combination with signaling and simulation data, this study provides mechanistic insights into CB1 activation by different classes of ligands, and sheds light on the G protein preferences between endogenous and exogenous ligands.",,10.1101/2022.08.06.502185,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.06.502185v1,2022.08.06.502185,08/07/2022,,2022-08-07,"Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA , USA.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Campus Drive, Stanford, California , USA.; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi -, Japan.","Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Campus Drive, Stanford, California , USA.; Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA , USA.; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi -, Japan.",,,0,,
