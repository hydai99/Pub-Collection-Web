Inductiverepresentation learning of temporal networks should be able to capture suchlaws and further be applied to systems that follow the same laws but have notbeen unseen during the training stage. Previous works in this area depend oneither network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail toextract these laws. Here, we propose Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs) toinductively represent a temporal network. CAWs are extracted by temporal randomwalks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to representnetwork dynamics while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting ofthose motifs. CAWs adopt a novel anonymization strategy that replaces nodeidentities with the hitting counts of the nodes based on a set of sampled walksto keep the method inductive, and simultaneously establish the correlationbetween motifs. We further propose a neural-network model CAW-N to encode CAWs,and pair it with a CAW sampling strategy with constant memory and time cost tosupport online training and inference. CAW-N is evaluated to predict links over6 real temporal networks and uniformly outperforms previous SOTA methods byaveraged 10% AUC gain in the inductive setting.

They haveshown great promise for Boolean biological interaction discovery that iscentral to advancing functional genomics and precision medicine. However,theoretical studies into how tree-based methods discover Boolean featureinteractions are missing. Inspired by the thresholding behavior in manybiological processes, we first introduce a novel discontinuous nonlinearregression model, called the Locally Spiky Sparse (LSS) model. Specifically,the LSS model assumes that the regression function is a linear combination ofpiecewise constant Boolean interaction terms. Given an RF tree ensemble, wedefine a quantity called Depth-Weighted Prevalence (DWP) for a set of signedfeatures S. Intuitively speaking, DWP(S) measures how frequently features in Sappear together in an RF tree ensemble. We prove that, with high probability,DWP(S) attains a universal upper bound that does not involve any modelcoefficients, if and only if S corresponds to a union of Boolean interactionsunder the LSS model. Consequentially, we show that a theoretically tractableversion of the iRF procedure, called LSSFind, yields consistent interactiondiscovery under the LSS model as the sample size goes to infinity.

We base CCE on two priorideas: counterfactual explanations and concept activation vectors, and validateour approach on well-known pretrained models, showing that it explains themodels' mistakes meaningfully. In addition, for new models trained on data withspurious correlations, CCE accurately identifies the spurious correlation asthe cause of model mistakes from a single misclassified test sample.

To this end, most animals use the sub-second excitable andmultistable dynamics of a neuromuscular system. Here, studying an animalwithout neurons or muscles, we report analogous excitable and multistabledynamics embedded in the physics of a 'walking' cilium. We define a 'walkingcilium' as a phenomena where the locomotive force is generated through contactwith a substrate which is periodically reset by steps in the direction ofmotion. We begin by showing that cilia can walk without specialized gaitcontrol and identify the characteristic scales of spatio-temporal heightfluctuations of the tissue. With the addition of surface interaction, weconstruct a low-order dynamical model of this single-cilium sub-unit. Inaddition to studying the dynamics of a single cilium in isolation, wesubsequently examine collections of these walking cilia. En route to anemergent model for ciliary walking, we demonstrate the limits of substratemediated synchronization between cilia. In the desynchronized limit, our modelshows evidence of localized multi-stability mediated by the crosstalk betweenlocomotive forcing and height. The out-of-equilibrium mechanics -- which governthis emergent excitable bistability -- directly control the locomotive forcingof a walking cilia. This direct coupling bypasses the role of the synapticjunctions between neurons and muscles.

Next, weexplore the implications of parametric driving in this active-elastic resonatorand show that such driving can excite mechanical 'spikes'. These spikes incollective mode amplitudes are consistent with a system driven by parametricamplification and a saturating nonlinearity. We conduct extensive numericalexperiments to corroborate these findings within a polarized active-elasticsheet. These results indicate that periodic and stochastic forcing are valuablefor increasing the sensitivity of collective ciliary flocking.

Most existing approaches leverage sparsity orlow-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrificeexpressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attentioncapability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memorycomplexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as aconditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate theconditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location canattend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirectattention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations ofembeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attentionpatterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design ofsuch factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$).

Materials such as topological insulators, complex oxides,quantum dots, color center hosting semiconductors, and other types of stronglycorrelated materials can exhibit exotic properties such as edge conductivity,multiferroicity, magnetoresistance, single photon emission, and optical-spinlocking. These emergent properties arise and depend strongly on the materialsdetailed atomic scale structure, including atomic defects, dopants, and latticestacking. In this review, after introduction of different classes of quantummaterials and quantum excitations, we describe how progress in the field ofelectron microscopy, including in situ and in operando EM, can accelerateadvances in quantum materials. Our review describes EM methods including: i)principles and operation modes of EM, ii) EM spectroscopies, such as electronenergy loss spectroscopy, cathodoluminescence, and electron energy gainspectroscopy, iii) 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, iv) dynamicand ultrafast EM, v) complimentary ultrafast spectroscopies, and vi) atomicelectron tomography. We discuss how these methods inform structure functionrelations in quantum materials down to the picometer scale and femtosecond timeresolution, and how they enable high resolution manipulation of quantummaterials. Among numerous results, our review highlights how EM has enabledidentification of the 3D structure of quantum defects, measuring reversible andmetastable dynamics of quantum excitations, mapping exciton states and singlephoton emission, measuring nanoscale thermal transport and coupled excitationdynamics, and measuring the internal electric field of quantumheterointerfaces, all at the quantum materials intrinsic atomic and nearatomic-length scale.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10099,arXiv:2212.10099v1,,,2022-12-20,12/20/2022,,Parivash Moradifar; Yin Liu; Jiaojian Shi; Matti Lawton Siukola Thurston; Hendrik Utzat; Tim B. van Driel; Aaron M.

This article systematically investigates the impact of these random factors independent of the papers quality on peer review outcomes in a major biomedical journal, eLife. We analyzed all of the submissions to eLife between 2016 to 2018, with 23,190 total submissions. We examined the effects of random factors at each decision point in the review process, from the gatekeeping senior editors who may desk-reject papers to review editors and reviewers who recommend the final outcome.

However, receptor-based cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), face many critical issues including target recognition escape, adverse side effects, and lack of in vivo control. Drug-controllable receptors offer a promising solution to overcome these issues through precise in vivo tuning of cells via enhanced sensing and therapeutic efficacy. Here we develop a novel class of modular and tunable receptors, termed valency-controlled receptors (VCRs), which can leverage customized small molecules to mediate cell signaling strength via controlled spatial clustering. We first develop DNA origami activated VCRs to demonstrate that receptor valency is a core mechanism that modulates immune cell activation. We design a series of customized valency-control ligands (VCLs) by transforming small molecule drugs into a multivalency format and modularly fusing VCR onto the CAR architecture. We demonstrate that VCL induction allows enhanced target sensitivity of engineered cells. Using medicinal chemistry, we develop programmable bioavailable VCL drugs to demonstrate that the VCR system enables drug-induced highly potent responses towards low antigen cancers in vitro and in vivo. Valency controlled receptors and customizable drug ligands provide a new synthetic biology platform to precisely tune engineered cell therapeutic potency, which can address existing safety and efficacy barriers in cell therapy.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.04.522664,1,new results,2023-01-04,01/04/2023,,Paul B.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

Here we show that ZIKV infection disrupts subcellular partitioning of host transcripts critical for neurodevelopment in NPCs and functionally link this process to the up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). UPF1 is an RNA-binding protein known to regulate decay of cellular and viral RNAs and is less expressed in ZIKV-infected cells. Using infrared crosslinking immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing (irCLIP-Seq), we show that a subset of mRNAs loses UPF1 binding in ZIKV-infected NPCs, consistent with UPF1's diminished expression. UPF1 target transcripts, however, are not altered in abundance but in subcellular localization, with mRNAs accumulating in the nucleus of infected or UPF1 knockdown cells.

In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1,new results,2023-01-07,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.
