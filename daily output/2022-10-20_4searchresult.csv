Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in agin, but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell specific Hmgcl deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that during aging, liver derived circulating ketone bodies might be more important for deactivating NLRP3 inflammasome and controlling organismal metabolism.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.14.512312,2,new results,01/16/2022,01/16/2022,,Emily L.

One of the most important phenotypes that differs between cells is their size, which was recently shown to be an important determinant of proteome composition in populations of similarly sized cells. We therefore sought to test if the effects of cell size on protein concentrations were also evident in single cell proteomics data. Using the relative concentrations of histone proteins to estimate a cells DNA-to-cell volume ratio, we found that cell size correlated with the cell-to-cell variance in two single cell proteome datasets, each acquired using different preparation and measurement platforms. Moreover, the proteome differences between small and large single cells significantly correlated with how cell size affects the proteomes of cultured cells measured in bulk. We therefore conclude that cell size accounts for a substantial amount of proteome heterogeneity in single cells and should be considered particularly when comparing cells of a similar type.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.17.512548,1,new results,01/17/2022,01/17/2022,,Michael C.

Different subsets of YAP target genes are engaged in each physiological setting, but how YAP selectively regulates different effectors in different contexts is not known. Here we use optogenetics to investigate how the levels and dynamics of YAP activation control its pluripotency effectors Oct4 and Nanog. We observe different thresholds for repression of Oct4 and Nanog, enabling differential control of both genes through YAP levels. Pluripotency factors also decode YAP dynamics. Oct4 preferentially responds to oscillatory YAP inputs that mimic endogenous pulsatile YAP dynamics. Using single-cell live imaging of Oct4 transcription and computational-theoretical analysis of transcriptional regulation, we demonstrate that YAP dynamics are decoded by an adaptive change sensor that modulates Oct4 transcription burst frequency. Our results reveal how the levels and timing of YAP activation enable multiplexing of information transmission for key regulators of cellular differentiation and pluripotency.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.17.512504,2,new results,01/18/2022,01/18/2022,,Kirstin Meyer; Nicholas C.

Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, also show diurnal rhythmicity in regulating local immune responses and synaptic remodeling. To investigate the interaction between aging and microglial circadian rhythmicity, we examined mice deficient in the core clock transcription factor, BMAL1. Aging Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline in association with suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation and increases in immature dendritic spines. C1q deposition at synapses and synaptic engulfment were significantly decreased in aging Bmal1-deficient microglia, suggesting that BMAL1 plays a role in regulating synaptic pruning in aging. In addition to accelerated age-associated hippocampal deficits, Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice also showed deficits in the sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness across light and dark phases. These results highlight an essential role of microglial BMAL1 in maintenance of synapse homeostasis in the aging brain.

Significance StatementThis study demonstrates that myeloid deficiency of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 disrupts microglial synaptic pruning in the hippocampus, accelerates age-associated cognitive decline, and disrupts the sleep-wake cycle.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.17.512618,1,new results,01/18/2022,01/18/2022,,Chinyere Agbaegbu Iweka; Erica Seigneur; Amira Latif Hernandez; Sur Herrera Paredes; Mica Cabrera; Eran Blacher; Connie Tsai Pasternak; Frank M.
