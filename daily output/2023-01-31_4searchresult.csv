Here, we show that increasing the local concentration of MPER-directed bNAbs at the cell surface via binding to the high-affinity Fc receptor FcγRI potentiates their ability to prevent viral entry in a manner analogous to the previously reported observation wherein the lipid-binding activity of MPER bNAbs increases their concentration at the viral surface membrane. However, binding of MPER-directed bNAb 10E8 to FcγRI abolishes the neutralization synergy that is seen with the N-heptad repeat (NHR)-targeting antibody D5_AR and NHR-targeting small molecule enfuvirtide (T20), possibly due to decreased accessibility of the NHR in the FcγRI-10E8-MPER complex. Taken together, our results suggest that lipid-binding activity and FcγRI-mediated potentiation function in concert to improve the potency of MPER-directed bNAbs by increasing their local concentration near the site of viral fusion. Therefore, lipid binding may not be a strict requirement for potent neutralization by MPER-targeting bNAbs, as alternative methods can achieve similar increases in local concentrations while avoiding potential liabilities associated with immunologic host tolerance.

However, the dynamics of this process are difficult to characterize in dominant gut species in their complex in vivo environment. Here we show that the fine-scale dynamics of genome-wide transposon libraries can enable quantitative inferences of these in vivo evolutionary forces. By analyzing >400,000 lineages across four human Bacteroides strains in gnotobiotic mice, we observed positive selection on thousands of previously hidden mutations - most of which were unrelated to their original gene knockouts. The spectrum of fitness benefits varied between species, and displayed diverse tradeoffs over time and in different dietary conditions, enabling inferences of their underlying function. These results suggest that within-host adaptations arise from an intense competition between numerous contending mutations, which can strongly influence their emergent evolutionary tradeoffs.",,,biorxiv;2022.05.13.491573,2,new results,2023-01-27,01/27/2023,,Daniel P.G.H.

Despite the importance of these metabolites to human health and disease, the origin of most microbially-produced molecules and their fate in the host remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover a host-microbe co-metabolic pathway for generation of hippuric acid, one of the most abundant organic acids in mammalian urine.

It is unknown how dietary changes influence liver homeostasis. Here, we show that a switch from ad libitum feeding to intermittent fasting (IF) promotes rapid hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of systemic FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat. This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.",intermittent fasting; liver; mouse; regeneration; regenerative medicine; stem cells,,,,,2023-02-01,2023/01/31,2023/2/1,Abby Sarkar; Yinhua Jin; Brian C DeFelice; Catriona Y Logan; Yan Yang; Teni Anbarchian; Peng Wu; Maurizio Morri; Norma F Neff; Huy Nguyen; Eric Rulifson; Matthew Fish; Avi Gurion Kaye; Azalia M Martínez Jaimes; Roel Nusse,,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.","Abby Sarkar: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Yinhua Jin: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Brian C DeFelice: Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.Catriona Y Logan: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Yan Yang: Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Teni Anbarchian: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Peng Wu: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Maurizio Morri: Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.Norma F Neff: Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.Huy Nguyen: Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Eric Rulifson: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Matthew Fish: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Avi Gurion Kaye: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Azalia M Martínez Jaimes: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.Roel Nusse: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States.",,,,,,0
