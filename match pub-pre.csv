However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs. Finally, our Cas13d guide efficiency model successfully generalized to DjCas13d, highlighting the utility of a comprehensive approach combining machine learning with ortholog discovery to advance RNA targeting in human cells.",,10.1101/2021.09.14.460134,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.14.460134v2,2021.09.14.460134,7/8/2022,,"Arc Institute; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University; Arc Institute; Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies; Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies; Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University; Arc Institute; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University; Arc Institute; Arc Institute; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Arc Institute; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Arc Institute; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Arc Institute; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University; Arc Institute",,,0.0,Now published in Sci Transl Med doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9522.,2

Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments. Both cause metagenotype errors.This dilemma can be mitigated by leveraging paired-end reads, customizing databases to species detected in the sample, and adjusting post-alignment filters.",,10.1101/2022.06.30.498336,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498336v1,2022.06.30.498336,7/2/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology","Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California",,,0.0,Now published in Sci Rep 10.1038/s41598-022-14450-0.,3

Using multiple waves of population-based cohort data from four MICs (China, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa), we undertook a longitudinal investigation into how individuals with hypertension move through care over time. We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models. Over a 5- to 9-year follow-up period, only around 30% of undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed [Mexico, 27% (95% confidence interval: 23%, 31%); China, 30% (26%, 33%); Indonesia, 30% (28%, 32%); and South Africa, 36% (31%, 41%)], and one in four untreated individuals became treated [Indonesia, 11% (10%, 12%); Mexico, 24% (20%, 28%); China, 26% (23%, 29%); and South Africa, 33% (29%, 38%)]. The probability of reaching blood pressure (BP) control was lower [Indonesia, 2% (1%, 2%); China, 9% (7%, 11%); Mexico, 12% (9%, 14%); and South Africa, 24% (20%, 28%)] regardless of treatment status. A substantial proportion of individuals discontinued treatment [Indonesia, 70% (67%, 73%); China, 36% (32%, 40%); Mexico, 34% (29%, 39%); and South Africa, 20% (15%, 25%)], and most individuals lost BP control by follow-up [Indonesia, 92% (89%, 96%); Mexico, 77% (71%, 83%); China, 76% (69%, 83%); and South Africa 45% (36%, 54%)]. Our results highlight that policies solely aimed at improving diagnosis or initiating treatment may not lead to long-term hypertension control improvements in MICs.",35857627.0,doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9522.,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9522,,7/6/2022,7/6/2022,"1 Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.2 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, 1060 Brussels, Belgium.3 Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.5 Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.6 MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit, School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand, 2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.7 Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.8 Center for Global Health and Development, Boston University, Boston, MA 02118, USA.9 Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.
