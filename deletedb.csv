In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far. We generated and analysed such mutants and describe a connection between AARE function, aggregation of oxidized proteins and plant ageing, including accelerated developmental progression and reduced life span. Our findings complement similar findings in animals and humans, and support a unified concept of ageing.",,10.1101/2022.05.18.492440,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.18.492440v2,2022.05.18.492440,7/26/2022,,"Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Molecular Botany, Department of Biology, Technical University of Kaiserslautern; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Signalling Research Centres BIOSS and CIBSS","Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Molecular Botany, Department of Biology, Technical University of Kaiserslautern; Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg; Signalling Research Centres BIOSS and CIBSS",,,0.0,,

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression. This study demonstrates that single-cell genomics and machine learning can generate a mechanistic model for how disruptions in cell communication selectively affect spatiotemporally dynamic regulatory networks in cardiogenesis.",,10.1101/2022.07.25.501458,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.25.501458v1,2022.07.25.501458,7/25/2022,,"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, UCSF School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone","Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, UCSF School of Medicine; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California",,,0.0,,

Fischbach",biorxiv,Strain dropouts reveal interactions that govern the metabolic output of the gut microbiome,"The gut microbiome is complex, raising questions about the role of individual strains in the community. Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology. Our work opens the door to the mechanistic studies of the role of an individual strain on community ecology and host physiology.",,10.1101/2022.07.25.501461,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.25.501461v1,2022.07.25.501461,7/25/2022,,"Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Anatomical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; Institute for Computational Biology, Case Western Reserve University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Anatomical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic; Institute for Computational Biology, Case Western Reserve University; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic; Center for Microbiome and Human Health, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Here we present Scriabin – a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of CCC at single-cell resolution. We leverage multiple published datasets to show that Scriabin recovers expected CCC edges and use spatial transcriptomic data, genetic perturbation screens, and direct experimental manipulation of receptor-ligand interactions to validate that the recovered edges are biologically meaningful. We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of CCC from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude. These results suggest that our EIS smart bone plate can provide continuous and highly sensitive quantitative tissue measurements throughout the course of fracture healing to better guide personalized clinical care.",,10.1101/2022.07.23.501237,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.23.501237v1,2022.07.23.501237,7/23/2022,,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Department of Clinical Sciences, Flint Animal Cancer Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Colorado State University; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital","Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital; Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Clinical Sciences, Flint Animal Cancer Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Colorado State University; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital",,,0.0,,

We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues.

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites. These methods demonstrate that COLLAPSE is computationally efficient, tunable, and interpretable, providing a general-purpose platform for computational protein analysis.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500713,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500713v1,2022.07.20.500713,7/22/2022,,"Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University; Departments of Bioengineering, Genetics, and Medicine, Stanford University","Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University; Departments of Bioengineering, Genetics, and Medicine, Stanford University",,,0.0,,

The ICHIRF-BRAIN Study","Mild traumatic brain injury is widely regarded as a misnomer: it is globally a major cause of disability and is hypothesized as a potential causal factor in subsequent neurodegeneration. Commonly arising in sport, mounting evidence of varying degrees of cognitive impairment in retired athletes exposed to repeated concussions motivates close examination of its cumulative effects on the brain. Studying a cohort of 125 retired athletes with a mean of 11 reported concussions and 36 matched controls with none, here we evaluated whole-brain volumetric and subcortical morphological effects with Bayesian regression models and functional connectivity effects with network-based statistics. Estimates of potential cognitive impact were derived from meta-analytic functional mapping based on 13,459 imaging studies. Across the array of brain structural and functional effects identified, regions significantly lower in volume in the concussed group included, in order of greatest effect size, the middle frontal gyrus, hippocampus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors. These findings suggest that engagement in sport may benefit the brain across numerous domains, but also highlights the potentially damaging effects of concussive head injury.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.22277627,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/22/2022.07.21.22277627.1,2022.07.21.22277627,7/22/2022,,"Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF)","The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London",,,0.0,,

Nayak",biorxiv,The dual role of a multi-heme cytochrome in methanogenesis: MmcA is important for energy conservation and carbon metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans,"Methanogenic archaea belonging to the Order Methanosarcinales conserve energy using an electron transport chain (ETC). In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex (Δrnf) or just the MmcA subunit (ΔmmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the ΔmmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the Δrnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.Importance Methane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500911,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500911v1,2022.07.20.500911,7/21/2022,,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California",,,0.0,,

Manual sample preparation remains a slow, expensive, and error-prone process. Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts – RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (−11x), cost (−3x), and biohazardous waste produced (−4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total).

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale. In contrast, we detected evidence for RuBisCO throughout the water column and sediments, including form II/III and form III-related enzymes encoded by CPR bacteria in the water column and DPANN archaea in the sediments. Overall, CPR bacteria and phages did not show strong signals of gene content differentiation by depth, despite the fact that distinct species groups populate different lake and sediment compartments. Thus, environmental gradients in Lac Pavin probably select for the capacities of CPR bacteria and phages to a lesser extent than other bacteria and archaea, possibly because selection on the former groups is indirect and depends on host characteristics.",,10.1101/2022.07.18.500538,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500538v1,2022.07.18.500538,7/19/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.16.500284v1,2022.07.16.500284,7/16/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3’s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3′-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center.

Inactivation of the Fanconi Anemia gene FANCA, the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) associated methyltransferase SETDB1 and the gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase and MutL (GHKL)-type ATPase MORC3 led to increased transgene expression. Moreover, SETDB1 and MORC3 knockout improved transgene levels of several AAV serotypes as well as other viral vectors, such as Lentivirus and Adenovirus. Finally, we demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of SETDB1 and MORC3 prior to viral vector administration enhanced transgene expression, providing a strategy for the improvement of gene therapy applications.",,10.1101/2022.07.13.499963,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.13.499963v1,2022.07.13.499963,7/14/2022,,Chan Zuckerberg Biohub,Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub,,,0.0,,

To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.Significance Statement Parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data. Combined, the results provide new information on how these important parasites accomplish the essential step of invasion.",,10.1101/2022.01.12.476068,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.476068v2,2022.01.12.476068,7/13/2022,,"Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Application (CAMERA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Mathematics, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh; Division of Cryo-EM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh; Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Mathematics, University of California; Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Application (CAMERA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Division of Cryo-EM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells.

Pollard",biorxiv,Maast: genotyping thousands of microbial strains efficiently,"Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of intraspecific genomes is a prerequisite to performing population genetic analysis and microbial epidemiology. However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maast’s utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak.

High doses of intravenously-delivered vector are required to reach the CNS, which has resulted in varying adverse effects. Moreover, selective transduction of various cell types might be important depending on the disorder being treated. To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids. We identified the amino acid (aa) from region 451-470 of AAV2 associated with the capsids selected for neurons, and a combination of aa from regions 413-496 of AAV-rh10 and 538-598 of AAV3B/LK03 associated with capsids selected for astrocytes.

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) – two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphic workflowThe Figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license.",,10.1101/2022.07.04.498721,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498721v1,2022.07.04.498721,7/4/2022,,"Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna","Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",,,0.0,,

Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,10.1101/2022.07.01.498451,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498451v1,2022.07.01.498451,7/3/2022,,"Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology","Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better.

Here we present cytoself, a deep-learning approach for fully self-supervised protein localization profiling and clustering. Cytoself leverages a self-supervised training scheme that does not require preexisting knowledge, categories or annotations. Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches.

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones.

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet-to-be-defined host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.

While the cyclical processes of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration characterizing their life cycle have been documented previously, the cellular and molecular changes associated with such processes and their relationship with variation in brain morphology and individual (zooid) behavior throughout adult life remains unknown. Here, we introduce Botryllus schlosseri as an invertebrate model for neurogenesis, neural degeneration, and evolutionary neuroscience. Our analysis reveals that during the weekly colony budding (i.e., asexual reproduction), prior to programmed cell death and removal by phagocytes, decreases in the number of neurons in the adult brain are associated with reduced behavioral response and significant change in the expression of 73 mammalian homologous genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Similarly, when comparing young colonies (1 to 2 y of age) to those reared in a laboratory for ∼20 y, we found that older colonies contained significantly fewer neurons and exhibited reduced behavioral response alongside changes in the expression of 148 such genes (35 of which were differentially expressed across both timescales). The existence of two distinct yet apparently related neurodegenerative pathways represents a novel platform to study the gene products governing the relationship between aging, neural regeneration and degeneration, and loss of nervous system function.

We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models. Over a 5- to 9-year follow-up period, only around 30% of undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed [Mexico, 27% (95% confidence interval: 23%, 31%); China, 30% (26%, 33%); Indonesia, 30% (28%, 32%); and South Africa, 36% (31%, 41%)], and one in four untreated individuals became treated [Indonesia, 11% (10%, 12%); Mexico, 24% (20%, 28%); China, 26% (23%, 29%); and South Africa, 33% (29%, 38%)]. The probability of reaching blood pressure (BP) control was lower [Indonesia, 2% (1%, 2%); China, 9% (7%, 11%); Mexico, 12% (9%, 14%); and South Africa, 24% (20%, 28%)] regardless of treatment status. A substantial proportion of individuals discontinued treatment [Indonesia, 70% (67%, 73%); China, 36% (32%, 40%); Mexico, 34% (29%, 39%); and South Africa, 20% (15%, 25%)], and most individuals lost BP control by follow-up [Indonesia, 92% (89%, 96%); Mexico, 77% (71%, 83%); China, 76% (69%, 83%); and South Africa 45% (36%, 54%)].

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.

Here we show that BET proteins should not be inactivated therapeutically because they are critical antiviral factors at the post-entry level. Depletion of BRD3 or BRD4 in cells overexpressing ACE2 exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infection; the same is observed when cells with endogenous ACE2 expression are treated with BET inhibitors during infection and not before. Viral replication and mortality are also enhanced in BET inhibitor-treated mice overexpressing ACE2. BET inactivation suppresses interferon production induced by SARS-CoV-2, a process phenocopied by the envelope (E) protein previously identified as a possible ""histone mimetic."" E protein, in an acetylated form, directly binds the second bromodomain of BRD4. Our data support a model where SARS-CoV-2 E protein evolved to antagonize interferon responses via BET protein inhibition; this neutralization should not be further enhanced with BET inhibitor treatment.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a recently established method for culture-independent LRTI diagnosis, but its utility for predicting AMR has remained unclear. We aimed to assess the performance of mNGS for AMR prediction in bacterial LRTI and demonstrate proof of concept for epidemiological AMR surveillance and rapid AMR gene detection using Cas9 enrichment and nanopore sequencing.              Methods:                    We studied 88 patients with acute respiratory failure between 07/2013 and 9/2018, enrolled through a previous observational study of LRTI. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory specimen collection within 72 h of intubation. Exclusion criteria were decline of study participation, unclear LRTI status, or no matched RNA and DNA mNGS data from a respiratory specimen. Patients with LRTI were identified by clinical adjudication. mNGS was performed on lower respiratory tract specimens. The primary outcome was mNGS performance for predicting phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and was assessed in patients with LRTI from culture-confirmed bacterial pathogens with clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing (n = 27 patients, n = 32 pathogens). Secondary outcomes included the association between hospital exposure and AMR gene burden in the respiratory microbiome (n = 88 patients), and AMR gene detection using Cas9 targeted enrichment and nanopore sequencing (n = 10 patients).              Results:                    Compared to clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the performance of respiratory mNGS for predicting AMR varied by pathogen, antimicrobial, and nucleic acid type sequenced. For gram-positive bacteria, a combination of RNA + DNA mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47-87%) and specificity of 95% (CI 85-99%). For gram-negative bacteria, sensitivity was 100% (CI 87-100%) and specificity 64% (CI 48-78%). Patients with hospital-onset LRTI had a greater AMR gene burden in their respiratory microbiome versus those with community-onset LRTI (p = 0.00030), or those without LRTI (p = 0.0024). We found that Cas9 targeted sequencing could enrich for low abundance AMR genes by > 2500-fold and enabled their rapid detection using a nanopore platform.              Conclusions:                    mNGS has utility for the detection and surveillance of resistant bacterial LRTI pathogens.",35818068.0,doi: 10.1186/s13073-022-01072-4.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9275031/,,,7/12/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 12;14(1):74.,0.0,,

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",35817986.0,doi: 10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y,,,7/11/2022,"1 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.6 Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.9 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.10 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.11 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.12 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.13 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.14 Diabetes Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.15 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.16 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.17 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.18 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 11.,0.0,,

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.",35803954.0,doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-31600-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9263813/,,,7/8/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.6 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.7 Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 8;13(1):3937.,0.0,,

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.

Conclusions:                    Given that these hypothetical proteins are near ubiquitous within major archaeal groups, we propose that they were important in the origin of most of the major archaeal lineages. Interestingly, although there were clearly phylum-specific co-occurring proteins, no such blocks of protein families were shared across superphyla, suggesting a burst-like origin of new lineages early in archaeal evolution.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to determine whether physical activity independently associates with expression of inflammatory genes among people with RA.              Methods:                    This was a prospective observational study of adults with RA. Physical activity was measured by quantitative actigraphy over 7 consecutive days, and peripheral blood collected during the same time period was used for RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses.              Results:                    Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56±12 years, 91% female, 31% white, 9% African American, 9% Asian, 40% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj<0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.              Conclusion:                    RA patients who were more physically active had lower expression of immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, even after adjusting for disease activity, suggesting that physical activity may confer a protective effect in RA.",35777820.0,doi: 10.3899/jrheum.220050.,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.220050,,,7/1/2022,"1 Division of Rheumatology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity. In summary, we provide an atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of epigenetic state can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.

A large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC. Advanced polyps contain increasing numbers of stem-like cells, regulatory T cells and a subtype of pre-cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the cancerous state, we observe T cell exhaustion, RUNX1-regulated cancer-associated fibroblasts and increasing accessibility associated with HNF4A motifs in epithelia.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.

While we can alter an organoid's morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid's morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer.",35637349.0,doi: 10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3,,5/30/2022,2022-07,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.4 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.5 Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.11 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.12 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.13 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.14 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.15 Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Jul;18(7):751-761.,0.0,,

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, Acj6 controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.

Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.",35584773.0,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04865-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9279157/,,5/18/2022,2022-07,"1 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.7 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Michael Hulton Center for HIV Cure Research at Gladstone, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, USA.11 Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.12 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.13 Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.14 Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.15 California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.16 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.17 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.18 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.19 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.20 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.21 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.22 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.23 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.24 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.25 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.26 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.27 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.28 Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.29 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.30 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.31 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.32 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.33 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul;607(7918):351-355.,0.0,,

Methods:                    Serum and CSF were screened by tissue-based assay and panned for candidate autoantibodies by phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq). The candidate antigen was validated by immunostaining knockout tissue and HEK 293T cell-based assay.              Results:                    Case 1 presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias after a recent diagnosis of serous uterine and fallopian carcinoma. Case 2 had a remote history of breast adenocarcinoma and presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias that progressed to generalized weakness. CSF and serum from both patients immunostained the axon initial segment (AIS) and node of Ranvier (NoR) of mice and enriched βIV-spectrin by PhIP-Seq. Patient CSF and serum failed to immunostain NoRs in dorsal root sensory neurons from βI/βIV-deficient mice. βIV-spectrin autoantibodies were confirmed by overexpression of AIS and nodal βIV-spectrin isoforms Σ1 and Σ6 by a cell-based assay. βIV-spectrin was not enriched in a combined 4,815 PhIP-Seq screens of healthy and other neurologic disease patients.

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency. This study sheds light on the role of co-occurring genetic alterations and on the effect of splicing factor deficiency on the modulation of sensitivity to targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapy.

In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far. We generated and analysed such mutants and describe a connection between AARE function, aggregation of oxidized proteins and plant ageing, including accelerated developmental progression and reduced life span.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression. This study demonstrates that single-cell genomics and machine learning can generate a mechanistic model for how disruptions in cell communication selectively affect spatiotemporally dynamic regulatory networks in cardiogenesis.",,10.1101/2022.07.25.501458,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.25.501458v1,2022.07.25.501458,7/25/2022,,"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, UCSF School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone","Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Medicine, Cardiology Division, UCSF School of Medicine; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Health Sciences, and Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Roddenberry Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at Gladstone; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California",,,0.0,,

Fischbach",biorxiv,Strain dropouts reveal interactions that govern the metabolic output of the gut microbiome,"The gut microbiome is complex, raising questions about the role of individual strains in the community. Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes.

We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues.

We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites.

Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database.

Commonly arising in sport, mounting evidence of varying degrees of cognitive impairment in retired athletes exposed to repeated concussions motivates close examination of its cumulative effects on the brain. Studying a cohort of 125 retired athletes with a mean of 11 reported concussions and 36 matched controls with none, here we evaluated whole-brain volumetric and subcortical morphological effects with Bayesian regression models and functional connectivity effects with network-based statistics. Estimates of potential cognitive impact were derived from meta-analytic functional mapping based on 13,459 imaging studies. Across the array of brain structural and functional effects identified, regions significantly lower in volume in the concussed group included, in order of greatest effect size, the middle frontal gyrus, hippocampus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors.

In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex (Δrnf) or just the MmcA subunit (ΔmmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the ΔmmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the Δrnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.Importance Methane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500911,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500911v1,2022.07.20.500911,7/21/2022,,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California",,,0.0,,

Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts – RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (−11x), cost (−3x), and biohazardous waste produced (−4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total).

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale.

Overall, CPR bacteria and phages did not show strong signals of gene content differentiation by depth, despite the fact that distinct species groups populate different lake and sediment compartments.

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases.

Smolke",biorxiv,Highly multiplexed selection of RNA aptamers against a small molecule library,"Applications of synthetic biology spanning human health, industrial bioproduction, and ecosystem monitoring often require small molecule sensing capabilities, typically in the form of genetically encoded small molecule biosensors. Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.16.500284v1,2022.07.16.500284,7/16/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3’s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3′-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.499945v1,2022.07.15.499945,7/16/2022,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",,,0.0,,

Inactivation of the Fanconi Anemia gene FANCA, the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) associated methyltransferase SETDB1 and the gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase and MutL (GHKL)-type ATPase MORC3 led to increased transgene expression. Moreover, SETDB1 and MORC3 knockout improved transgene levels of several AAV serotypes as well as other viral vectors, such as Lentivirus and Adenovirus.

To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.Significance Statement Parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data.

However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maast’s utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak.

High doses of intravenously-delivered vector are required to reach the CNS, which has resulted in varying adverse effects.

To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids.

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) – two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphic workflowThe Figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license.",,10.1101/2022.07.04.498721,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498721v1,2022.07.04.498721,7/4/2022,,"Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna","Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",,,0.0,,

Garcia",biorxiv,Competing constraints shape the non-equilibrium limits of cellular decision making,"Gene regulation is central to cellular function. Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,10.1101/2022.07.01.498451,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498451v1,2022.07.01.498451,7/3/2022,,"Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology","Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

We hypothesized that phyllosphere interactions may be disrupted in a greenhouse setting, where microbial dispersal is limited, and that adding a microbial amendment might yield important benefits to the host plant.Using a newly developed synthetic phyllosphere microbiome for Tomato, we tested this hypothesis across multiple trials by manipulating microbial colonization of leaves and measuring subsequent plant growth and reproductive success, comparing results from plants grown in both greenhouse and field settings.We confirmed that greenhouse-grown plants have a depauperate phyllosphere microbiome and that the addition of the synthetic microbial community was responsible for a clear and repeatable increase in fruit production in this setting. We further show that this effect is synergistic with the addition of micronutrient-based soil amendments, with important implications for agriculture.These results suggest that greenhouse environments have poor phyllosphere microbiome establishment, with negative impacts on the plant.

Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments.

Here, we identify RNAPII as the major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size in budding yeast as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the general transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content. This drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is precisely compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Disruption of both mTOR complexes leads to pronounced deficits in dopamine release demonstrating the importance of balanced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling for dopaminergic function.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones. Together, these results provide a comprehensive map of the cycling human breast.

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet-to-be-defined host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.

Addition of a hydrophilic peptide shows that polypeptides entering through PA28 are held in the antechamber of 20S prior to degradation in the proteolytic chamber.

While the cyclical processes of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration characterizing their life cycle have been documented previously, the cellular and molecular changes associated with such processes and their relationship with variation in brain morphology and individual (zooid) behavior throughout adult life remains unknown. Here, we introduce Botryllus schlosseri as an invertebrate model for neurogenesis, neural degeneration, and evolutionary neuroscience. Our analysis reveals that during the weekly colony budding (i.e., asexual reproduction), prior to programmed cell death and removal by phagocytes, decreases in the number of neurons in the adult brain are associated with reduced behavioral response and significant change in the expression of 73 mammalian homologous genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Similarly, when comparing young colonies (1 to 2 y of age) to those reared in a laboratory for ∼20 y, we found that older colonies contained significantly fewer neurons and exhibited reduced behavioral response alongside changes in the expression of 148 such genes (35 of which were differentially expressed across both timescales). The existence of two distinct yet apparently related neurodegenerative pathways represents a novel platform to study the gene products governing the relationship between aging, neural regeneration and degeneration, and loss of nervous system function. Indeed, as a member of an evolutionary clade considered to be a sister group of vertebrates, this organism may be a fundamental resource in understanding how evolution has shaped these processes across phylogeny and obtaining mechanistic insight.

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a recently established method for culture-independent LRTI diagnosis, but its utility for predicting AMR has remained unclear. We aimed to assess the performance of mNGS for AMR prediction in bacterial LRTI and demonstrate proof of concept for epidemiological AMR surveillance and rapid AMR gene detection using Cas9 enrichment and nanopore sequencing.              Methods:                    We studied 88 patients with acute respiratory failure between 07/2013 and 9/2018, enrolled through a previous observational study of LRTI. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory specimen collection within 72 h of intubation. Exclusion criteria were decline of study participation, unclear LRTI status, or no matched RNA and DNA mNGS data from a respiratory specimen. Patients with LRTI were identified by clinical adjudication. mNGS was performed on lower respiratory tract specimens. The primary outcome was mNGS performance for predicting phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and was assessed in patients with LRTI from culture-confirmed bacterial pathogens with clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing (n = 27 patients, n = 32 pathogens). Secondary outcomes included the association between hospital exposure and AMR gene burden in the respiratory microbiome (n = 88 patients), and AMR gene detection using Cas9 targeted enrichment and nanopore sequencing (n = 10 patients).              Results:                    Compared to clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the performance of respiratory mNGS for predicting AMR varied by pathogen, antimicrobial, and nucleic acid type sequenced. For gram-positive bacteria, a combination of RNA + DNA mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47-87%) and specificity of 95% (CI 85-99%). For gram-negative bacteria, sensitivity was 100% (CI 87-100%) and specificity 64% (CI 48-78%). Patients with hospital-onset LRTI had a greater AMR gene burden in their respiratory microbiome versus those with community-onset LRTI (p = 0.00030), or those without LRTI (p = 0.0024). We found that Cas9 targeted sequencing could enrich for low abundance AMR genes by > 2500-fold and enabled their rapid detection using a nanopore platform.              Conclusions:                    mNGS has utility for the detection and surveillance of resistant bacterial LRTI pathogens.",35818068.0,doi: 10.1186/s13073-022-01072-4.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9275031/,,,7/12/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 12;14(1):74.,0.0,,

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",35817986.0,doi: 10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y,,,7/11/2022,"1 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.6 Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.9 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.10 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.11 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.12 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.13 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.14 Diabetes Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.15 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.16 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.17 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.18 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 11.,0.0,,

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.",35803954.0,doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-31600-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9263813/,,,7/8/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.6 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.7 Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 8;13(1):3937.,0.0,,

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.

Recent genomic analyses have profoundly reshaped our understanding of the distribution and functionalities of Archaea and their roles in eukaryotic evolution.              Results:                    Here, 1179 representative genomes were selected from 3197 archaeal genomes. The representative genomes clustered based on the content of 10,866 newly defined archaeal protein families (that will serve as a community resource) recapitulates archaeal phylogeny. We identified the co-occurring proteins that distinguish the major lineages. Those with metabolic roles were consistent with experimental data. However, two families specific to Asgard were determined to be new eukaryotic signature proteins. Overall, the blocks of lineage-specific families are dominated by proteins that lack functional predictions.              Conclusions:                    Given that these hypothetical proteins are near ubiquitous within major archaeal groups, we propose that they were important in the origin of most of the major archaeal lineages. Interestingly, although there were clearly phylum-specific co-occurring proteins, no such blocks of protein families were shared across superphyla, suggesting a burst-like origin of new lineages early in archaeal evolution.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to determine whether physical activity independently associates with expression of inflammatory genes among people with RA.              Methods:                    This was a prospective observational study of adults with RA. Physical activity was measured by quantitative actigraphy over 7 consecutive days, and peripheral blood collected during the same time period was used for RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses.              Results:                    Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56±12 years, 91% female, 31% white, 9% African American, 9% Asian, 40% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj<0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells.

A large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC. Advanced polyps contain increasing numbers of stem-like cells, regulatory T cells and a subtype of pre-cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the cancerous state, we observe T cell exhaustion, RUNX1-regulated cancer-associated fibroblasts and increasing accessibility associated with HNF4A motifs in epithelia.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.

While we can alter an organoid's morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid's morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer.",35637349.0,doi: 10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3,,5/30/2022,2022-07,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.4 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.5 Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.11 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.12 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.13 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.14 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.15 Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Jul;18(7):751-761.,0.0,,

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, Acj6 controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.

Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.",35584773.0,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04865-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9279157/,,5/18/2022,2022-07,"1 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.7 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Michael Hulton Center for HIV Cure Research at Gladstone, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, USA.11 Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.12 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.13 Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.14 Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.15 California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.16 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.17 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.18 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.19 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.20 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.21 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.22 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.23 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.24 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.25 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.26 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.27 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.28 Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.29 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.30 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.31 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.32 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.33 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul;607(7918):351-355.,0.0,,

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency. This study sheds light on the role of co-occurring genetic alterations and on the effect of splicing factor deficiency on the modulation of sensitivity to targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapy.

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physicochemical data and 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize the sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 30% of those currently known, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. 16S rRNA gene amplicon screening of 224 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs retrieved from a single site are representative of the microbial community in the vent field sediments. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison between Auka MAGs and MAGs from Guaymas Basin revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap, suggestive of long-distance species transfer over 400 km and subsequent sediment colonization. Optimal growth temperature prediction on the Auka MAGs, and thousands of reference genomes, shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently. Taken together, our Auka vent field results offer new perspectives on our understanding of hydrothermal vent microbiology.",35352015.0,doi: 10.1038/s41396-022-01222-x.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9213671/,,3/28/2022,2022-07,"1 Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA. dspeth@mpi-bremen.de.2 Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA. dspeth@mpi-bremen.de.3 Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Bremen, Germany. dspeth@mpi-bremen.de.4 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.7 Facultad de Ciencias Marinas, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico.8 Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA. vorphan@gps.caltech.edu.9 Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA. vorphan@gps.caltech.edu.",,,2022 Jul;16(7):1750-1764.,0.0,,

In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far. We generated and analysed such mutants and describe a connection between AARE function, aggregation of oxidized proteins and plant ageing, including accelerated developmental progression and reduced life span.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression.

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues. Thus ACE+ macrophages have differential capacity to serve as cellular niche for intracellular bacteria to establish persistent infection.Teaser This study shows that ACE+ granuloma macrophages have restricted capacity to act as a cellular niche that enables intracellular bacterial persistence.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.501041,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501041v1,2022.07.21.501041,7/22/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites.

Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database.

The ICHIRF-BRAIN Study","Mild traumatic brain injury is widely regarded as a misnomer: it is globally a major cause of disability and is hypothesized as a potential causal factor in subsequent neurodegeneration. Commonly arising in sport, mounting evidence of varying degrees of cognitive impairment in retired athletes exposed to repeated concussions motivates close examination of its cumulative effects on the brain. Studying a cohort of 125 retired athletes with a mean of 11 reported concussions and 36 matched controls with none, here we evaluated whole-brain volumetric and subcortical morphological effects with Bayesian regression models and functional connectivity effects with network-based statistics. Estimates of potential cognitive impact were derived from meta-analytic functional mapping based on 13,459 imaging studies. Across the array of brain structural and functional effects identified, regions significantly lower in volume in the concussed group included, in order of greatest effect size, the middle frontal gyrus, hippocampus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors. These findings suggest that engagement in sport may benefit the brain across numerous domains, but also highlights the potentially damaging effects of concussive head injury.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.22277627,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/22/2022.07.21.22277627.1,2022.07.21.22277627,7/22/2022,,"Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF)","The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London",,,0.0,,

Nayak",biorxiv,The dual role of a multi-heme cytochrome in methanogenesis: MmcA is important for energy conservation and carbon metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans,"Methanogenic archaea belonging to the Order Methanosarcinales conserve energy using an electron transport chain (ETC). In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex (Δrnf) or just the MmcA subunit (ΔmmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the ΔmmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the Δrnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.Importance Methane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500911,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500911v1,2022.07.20.500911,7/21/2022,,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California",,,0.0,,

Clonal analysis revealed that IgM memory B cells were more proliferative than any other B cell subtype, and that cells from the same clone had highly concordant fates. We found that transcriptional memory within clones varies across genes, with strongest persistence in genes related to cell fate determination.

Manual sample preparation remains a slow, expensive, and error-prone process. Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts – RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (−11x), cost (−3x), and biohazardous waste produced (−4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total).

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale. In contrast, we detected evidence for RuBisCO throughout the water column and sediments, including form II/III and form III-related enzymes encoded by CPR bacteria in the water column and DPANN archaea in the sediments. Overall, CPR bacteria and phages did not show strong signals of gene content differentiation by depth, despite the fact that distinct species groups populate different lake and sediment compartments. Thus, environmental gradients in Lac Pavin probably select for the capacities of CPR bacteria and phages to a lesser extent than other bacteria and archaea, possibly because selection on the former groups is indirect and depends on host characteristics.",,10.1101/2022.07.18.500538,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500538v1,2022.07.18.500538,7/19/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Laboratoire Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement (LMGE), UMR CNRS 6023, Université Clermont-Auvergne; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.16.500284v1,2022.07.16.500284,7/16/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3’s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3′-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.499945v1,2022.07.15.499945,7/16/2022,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",,,0.0,,

To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.Significance Statement Parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data. Combined, the results provide new information on how these important parasites accomplish the essential step of invasion.",,10.1101/2022.01.12.476068,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.476068v2,2022.01.12.476068,7/13/2022,,"Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Application (CAMERA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Mathematics, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh; Division of Cryo-EM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh; Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Mathematics, University of California; Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Application (CAMERA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Division of Cryo-EM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs.

Pollard",biorxiv,Maast: genotyping thousands of microbial strains efficiently,"Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of intraspecific genomes is a prerequisite to performing population genetic analysis and microbial epidemiology. However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maast’s utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maast is a fast, reliable SNP genotyping tool that empowers population genetic meta-analysis of microbes at an unrivaled scale.Availability source code of Maast is available at https://github.com/zjshi/Maast.Contact kpollard{at}gladstone.ucsf.edu",,10.1101/2022.07.06.499075,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.499075v1,2022.07.06.499075,7/7/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Energy, Joint Genome Institute; Gladstone Institutes, Data Science and Biotechnology; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division; University of California San Francisco, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics","Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institutes, Data Science and Biotechnology; Department of Energy, Joint Genome Institute; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institutes, Data Science and Biotechnology; University of California San Francisco, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics",,,0.0,,

High doses of intravenously-delivered vector are required to reach the CNS, which has resulted in varying adverse effects. Moreover, selective transduction of various cell types might be important depending on the disorder being treated. To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids. We identified the amino acid (aa) from region 451-470 of AAV2 associated with the capsids selected for neurons, and a combination of aa from regions 413-496 of AAV-rh10 and 538-598 of AAV3B/LK03 associated with capsids selected for astrocytes.

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) – two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphic workflowThe Figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license.",,10.1101/2022.07.04.498721,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498721v1,2022.07.04.498721,7/4/2022,,"Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna","Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",,,0.0,,

Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,10.1101/2022.07.01.498451,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498451v1,2022.07.01.498451,7/3/2022,,"Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology","Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

We further show that this effect is synergistic with the addition of micronutrient-based soil amendments, with important implications for agriculture.These results suggest that greenhouse environments have poor phyllosphere microbiome establishment, with negative impacts on the plant.

Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments.

Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress.

Here we present cytoself, a deep-learning approach for fully self-supervised protein localization profiling and clustering. Cytoself leverages a self-supervised training scheme that does not require preexisting knowledge, categories or annotations. Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches.

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones.

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet-to-be-defined host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.

While the cyclical processes of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration characterizing their life cycle have been documented previously, the cellular and molecular changes associated with such processes and their relationship with variation in brain morphology and individual (zooid) behavior throughout adult life remains unknown. Here, we introduce Botryllus schlosseri as an invertebrate model for neurogenesis, neural degeneration, and evolutionary neuroscience. Our analysis reveals that during the weekly colony budding (i.e., asexual reproduction), prior to programmed cell death and removal by phagocytes, decreases in the number of neurons in the adult brain are associated with reduced behavioral response and significant change in the expression of 73 mammalian homologous genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Similarly, when comparing young colonies (1 to 2 y of age) to those reared in a laboratory for ∼20 y, we found that older colonies contained significantly fewer neurons and exhibited reduced behavioral response alongside changes in the expression of 148 such genes (35 of which were differentially expressed across both timescales). The existence of two distinct yet apparently related neurodegenerative pathways represents a novel platform to study the gene products governing the relationship between aging, neural regeneration and degeneration, and loss of nervous system function.

We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models. Over a 5- to 9-year follow-up period, only around 30% of undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed [Mexico, 27% (95% confidence interval: 23%, 31%); China, 30% (26%, 33%); Indonesia, 30% (28%, 32%); and South Africa, 36% (31%, 41%)], and one in four untreated individuals became treated [Indonesia, 11% (10%, 12%); Mexico, 24% (20%, 28%); China, 26% (23%, 29%); and South Africa, 33% (29%, 38%)]. The probability of reaching blood pressure (BP) control was lower [Indonesia, 2% (1%, 2%); China, 9% (7%, 11%); Mexico, 12% (9%, 14%); and South Africa, 24% (20%, 28%)] regardless of treatment status. A substantial proportion of individuals discontinued treatment [Indonesia, 70% (67%, 73%); China, 36% (32%, 40%); Mexico, 34% (29%, 39%); and South Africa, 20% (15%, 25%)], and most individuals lost BP control by follow-up [Indonesia, 92% (89%, 96%); Mexico, 77% (71%, 83%); China, 76% (69%, 83%); and South Africa 45% (36%, 54%)]. Our results highlight that policies solely aimed at improving diagnosis or initiating treatment may not lead to long-term hypertension control improvements in MICs.",35857627.0,doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9522.,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9522,,7/6/2022,7/6/2022,"1 Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.2 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, 1060 Brussels, Belgium.3 Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.5 Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.6 MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit, School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand, 2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.7 Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.8 Center for Global Health and Development, Boston University, Boston, MA 02118, USA.9 Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.

Here we show that BET proteins should not be inactivated therapeutically because they are critical antiviral factors at the post-entry level. Depletion of BRD3 or BRD4 in cells overexpressing ACE2 exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infection; the same is observed when cells with endogenous ACE2 expression are treated with BET inhibitors during infection and not before. Viral replication and mortality are also enhanced in BET inhibitor-treated mice overexpressing ACE2. BET inactivation suppresses interferon production induced by SARS-CoV-2, a process phenocopied by the envelope (E) protein previously identified as a possible ""histone mimetic."" E protein, in an acetylated form, directly binds the second bromodomain of BRD4. Our data support a model where SARS-CoV-2 E protein evolved to antagonize interferon responses via BET protein inhibition; this neutralization should not be further enhanced with BET inhibitor treatment.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a recently established method for culture-independent LRTI diagnosis, but its utility for predicting AMR has remained unclear. We aimed to assess the performance of mNGS for AMR prediction in bacterial LRTI and demonstrate proof of concept for epidemiological AMR surveillance and rapid AMR gene detection using Cas9 enrichment and nanopore sequencing.              Methods:                    We studied 88 patients with acute respiratory failure between 07/2013 and 9/2018, enrolled through a previous observational study of LRTI. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory specimen collection within 72 h of intubation. Exclusion criteria were decline of study participation, unclear LRTI status, or no matched RNA and DNA mNGS data from a respiratory specimen. Patients with LRTI were identified by clinical adjudication. mNGS was performed on lower respiratory tract specimens. The primary outcome was mNGS performance for predicting phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and was assessed in patients with LRTI from culture-confirmed bacterial pathogens with clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing (n = 27 patients, n = 32 pathogens). Secondary outcomes included the association between hospital exposure and AMR gene burden in the respiratory microbiome (n = 88 patients), and AMR gene detection using Cas9 targeted enrichment and nanopore sequencing (n = 10 patients).              Results:                    Compared to clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the performance of respiratory mNGS for predicting AMR varied by pathogen, antimicrobial, and nucleic acid type sequenced. For gram-positive bacteria, a combination of RNA + DNA mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47-87%) and specificity of 95% (CI 85-99%). For gram-negative bacteria, sensitivity was 100% (CI 87-100%) and specificity 64% (CI 48-78%). Patients with hospital-onset LRTI had a greater AMR gene burden in their respiratory microbiome versus those with community-onset LRTI (p = 0.00030), or those without LRTI (p = 0.0024). We found that Cas9 targeted sequencing could enrich for low abundance AMR genes by > 2500-fold and enabled their rapid detection using a nanopore platform.              Conclusions:                    mNGS has utility for the detection and surveillance of resistant bacterial LRTI pathogens.",35818068.0,doi: 10.1186/s13073-022-01072-4.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9275031/,,,7/12/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 12;14(1):74.,0.0,,

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",35817986.0,doi: 10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y,,,7/11/2022,"1 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.6 Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.9 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.10 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.11 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.12 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.13 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.14 Diabetes Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.15 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.16 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.17 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.18 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 11.,0.0,,

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.",35803954.0,doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-31600-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9263813/,,,7/8/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.6 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.7 Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 8;13(1):3937.,0.0,,

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.

Recent genomic analyses have profoundly reshaped our understanding of the distribution and functionalities of Archaea and their roles in eukaryotic evolution.              Results:                    Here, 1179 representative genomes were selected from 3197 archaeal genomes. The representative genomes clustered based on the content of 10,866 newly defined archaeal protein families (that will serve as a community resource) recapitulates archaeal phylogeny. We identified the co-occurring proteins that distinguish the major lineages. Those with metabolic roles were consistent with experimental data. However, two families specific to Asgard were determined to be new eukaryotic signature proteins. Overall, the blocks of lineage-specific families are dominated by proteins that lack functional predictions.              Conclusions:                    Given that these hypothetical proteins are near ubiquitous within major archaeal groups, we propose that they were important in the origin of most of the major archaeal lineages. Interestingly, although there were clearly phylum-specific co-occurring proteins, no such blocks of protein families were shared across superphyla, suggesting a burst-like origin of new lineages early in archaeal evolution.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to determine whether physical activity independently associates with expression of inflammatory genes among people with RA.              Methods:                    This was a prospective observational study of adults with RA. Physical activity was measured by quantitative actigraphy over 7 consecutive days, and peripheral blood collected during the same time period was used for RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses.              Results:                    Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56±12 years, 91% female, 31% white, 9% African American, 9% Asian, 40% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj<0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.              Conclusion:                    RA patients who were more physically active had lower expression of immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, even after adjusting for disease activity, suggesting that physical activity may confer a protective effect in RA.",35777820.0,doi: 10.3899/jrheum.220050.,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.220050,,,7/1/2022,"1 Division of Rheumatology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity. In summary, we provide an atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of epigenetic state can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.

A large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC. Advanced polyps contain increasing numbers of stem-like cells, regulatory T cells and a subtype of pre-cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the cancerous state, we observe T cell exhaustion, RUNX1-regulated cancer-associated fibroblasts and increasing accessibility associated with HNF4A motifs in epithelia.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.

While we can alter an organoid's morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid's morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer.",35637349.0,doi: 10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3,,5/30/2022,2022-07,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.4 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.5 Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.11 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.12 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.13 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.14 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.15 Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Jul;18(7):751-761.,0.0,,

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, Acj6 controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.

Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.",35584773.0,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04865-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9279157/,,5/18/2022,2022-07,"1 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.7 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Michael Hulton Center for HIV Cure Research at Gladstone, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, USA.11 Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.12 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.13 Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.14 Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.15 California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.16 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.17 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.18 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.19 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.20 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.21 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.22 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.23 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.24 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.25 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.26 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.27 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.28 Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.29 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.30 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.31 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.32 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.33 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul;607(7918):351-355.,0.0,,

Methods:                    Serum and CSF were screened by tissue-based assay and panned for candidate autoantibodies by phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq). The candidate antigen was validated by immunostaining knockout tissue and HEK 293T cell-based assay.              Results:                    Case 1 presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias after a recent diagnosis of serous uterine and fallopian carcinoma. Case 2 had a remote history of breast adenocarcinoma and presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias that progressed to generalized weakness.

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency. This study sheds light on the role of co-occurring genetic alterations and on the effect of splicing factor deficiency on the modulation of sensitivity to targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapy.

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physicochemical data and 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize the sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 30% of those currently known, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. 16S rRNA gene amplicon screening of 224 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs retrieved from a single site are representative of the microbial community in the vent field sediments. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison between Auka MAGs and MAGs from Guaymas Basin revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap, suggestive of long-distance species transfer over 400 km and subsequent sediment colonization. Optimal growth temperature prediction on the Auka MAGs, and thousands of reference genomes, shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently.

CRISPR screens have nominated gene targets for engineered T cells, but improved methods are required to compare large numbers of synthetic knockin sequences to reprogram cell functions. Here, we developed Modular Pooled Knockin Screening (ModPoKI), an adaptable platform for modular construction of DNA knockin libraries using barcoded multicistronic adaptors. We built two ModPoKI libraries of 100 transcription factors (TFs) and 129 natural and synthetic surface receptors. Over 20 ModPoKI screens across human TCR and CAR T cells in diverse conditions identified a transcription factor AP4 (TFAP4) construct to enhance long-term T cell fitness and anti-cancer function in vitro and in vivo.

Here we provide a single nucleus and single cell RNA-seq resource covering all of spermatogenesis in Drosophila starting from in-depth analysis of adult testis single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from the Fly Cell Atlas (FCA) study (Li et al., 2022). With over 44,000 nuclei and 6,000 cells analyzed, the data provide identification of rare cell types, mapping of intermediate steps in differentiation, and the potential to identify new factors impacting fertility or controlling differentiation of germline and supporting somatic cells. We justify assignment of key germline and somatic cell types using combinations of known markers, in situ hybridization, and analysis of extant protein traps. Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation. To complement the web-based portals for data analysis hosted by the FCA, we provide datasets compatible with commonly used software such as Seurat and Monocle.

In response, cells mount complex responses across multiple scales, including adjusting their shape to withstand stress. In enterobacteria, the Rcs phosphorelay is activated by cell envelope damage and by changes to periplasmic dimensions and cell width. Here, we investigated the physiological and morphological consequences of Rcs activation in Escherichia coli in the absence of stresses, using an inducible version of RcsF that mislocalizes to the inner membrane, RcsFIM. Expression of RcsFIM immediately reduced cellular growth rate and the added length per cell cycle in a manner that was directly dependent on induction levels, but independent of Rcs-induced capsule production. At the same time, cells increased intracellular concentration of the cell division protein FtsZ, and decreased the distance between division rings in filamentous cells. Depletion of the Rcs negative regulator IgaA phenocopied RcsFIM induction, indicating that IgaA is essential due to growth inhibition in its absence. However, A22 treatment did not affect growth rate or FtsZ intracellular concentration, despite activating the Rcs system. These findings suggest that the effect of Rcs activation on FtsZ levels is mediated indirectly through growth-rate changes, and highlight feedbacks among the Rcs stress response, growth dynamics, and cell-size control.",,10.1101/2022.07.26.501648,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501648v1,2022.07.26.501648,07/27/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,1.0,,

In Escherichia coli, the Rcs system is required to survive A22 and mecillinam treatment, two drugs that perturb cell size. To test whether cell size changes might be correlated with envelope damage and thereby sensed by the Rcs system, we tuned E. coli cell size via drug inhibition with A22, point mutations to the cell-shape determinant MreB, and mechanically confined growth. In all conditions, cell width was strongly correlated with Rcs activation, with wider cells exhibiting more activation than wild-type. In all conditions, RcsF, the outer membrane-localized upstream component of the Rcs system, was essential for responding to cell width changes. Consistently, several envelope gene deletions known to induce the Rcs system via RcsF resulted in cells that were wider than wild-type. Cryo- electron microscopy revealed that the periplasm of a wide MreB mutant was on average ∼3 nm thinner than wild-type, thereby bringing RcsF closer to the downstream components of the signaling cascade in the inner membrane. Conversely, extending the flexible linker region of RcsF by ∼3 nm increased Rcs activity in wild-type cells.

Using bioinformatics and chemoproteomics, we identify serine hydrolases in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that are specific to the Bacteroidetes phylum. Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling. Functional studies reveal that BT4193 is a true homolog of hDPP4 while the other is misannotated and is a proline-specific triaminopeptidase. We demonstrate that BT4193 is important for envelope integrity and is inhibited by FDA-approved type 2 diabetes drugs that target hDPP4. Loss of BT4193 reduces B. thetaiotaomicron fitness during in vitro growth within a diverse community.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression.

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues. Thus ACE+ macrophages have differential capacity to serve as cellular niche for intracellular bacteria to establish persistent infection.Teaser This study shows that ACE+ granuloma macrophages have restricted capacity to act as a cellular niche that enables intracellular bacterial persistence.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.501041,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501041v1,2022.07.21.501041,7/22/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites.

The ICHIRF-BRAIN Study","Mild traumatic brain injury is widely regarded as a misnomer: it is globally a major cause of disability and is hypothesized as a potential causal factor in subsequent neurodegeneration. Commonly arising in sport, mounting evidence of varying degrees of cognitive impairment in retired athletes exposed to repeated concussions motivates close examination of its cumulative effects on the brain. Studying a cohort of 125 retired athletes with a mean of 11 reported concussions and 36 matched controls with none, here we evaluated whole-brain volumetric and subcortical morphological effects with Bayesian regression models and functional connectivity effects with network-based statistics. Estimates of potential cognitive impact were derived from meta-analytic functional mapping based on 13,459 imaging studies. Across the array of brain structural and functional effects identified, regions significantly lower in volume in the concussed group included, in order of greatest effect size, the middle frontal gyrus, hippocampus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors.

Nayak",biorxiv,The dual role of a multi-heme cytochrome in methanogenesis: MmcA is important for energy conservation and carbon metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans,"Methanogenic archaea belonging to the Order Methanosarcinales conserve energy using an electron transport chain (ETC). In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex (Δrnf) or just the MmcA subunit (ΔmmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the ΔmmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the Δrnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.Importance Methane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500911,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500911v1,2022.07.20.500911,7/21/2022,,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California",,,0.0,,

Clonal analysis revealed that IgM memory B cells were more proliferative than any other B cell subtype, and that cells from the same clone had highly concordant fates.

Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts – RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (−11x), cost (−3x), and biohazardous waste produced (−4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total).

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale. In contrast, we detected evidence for RuBisCO throughout the water column and sediments, including form II/III and form III-related enzymes encoded by CPR bacteria in the water column and DPANN archaea in the sediments. Overall, CPR bacteria and phages did not show strong signals of gene content differentiation by depth, despite the fact that distinct species groups populate different lake and sediment compartments.

From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases. In summary, our findings suggest that integrating host transcriptional profiling and broad-range metagenomic pathogen detection from nucleic acid may hold promise as a tool for sepsis diagnosis.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.22277700,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/17/2022.07.16.22277700,2022.07.16.22277700,7/17/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California San Francisco; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Western University; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital; Washington University","Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Western University; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Western University; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Washington University; Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Smolke",biorxiv,Highly multiplexed selection of RNA aptamers against a small molecule library,"Applications of synthetic biology spanning human health, industrial bioproduction, and ecosystem monitoring often require small molecule sensing capabilities, typically in the form of genetically encoded small molecule biosensors. Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.16.500284v1,2022.07.16.500284,7/16/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3’s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3′-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.499945v1,2022.07.15.499945,7/16/2022,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",,,0.0,,

Our screens revealed several components linked to DNA damage response, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Inactivation of the Fanconi Anemia gene FANCA, the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) associated methyltransferase SETDB1 and the gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase and MutL (GHKL)-type ATPase MORC3 led to increased transgene expression. Moreover, SETDB1 and MORC3 knockout improved transgene levels of several AAV serotypes as well as other viral vectors, such as Lentivirus and Adenovirus.

To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.Significance Statement Parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data.

Pollard",biorxiv,Maast: genotyping thousands of microbial strains efficiently,"Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of intraspecific genomes is a prerequisite to performing population genetic analysis and microbial epidemiology. However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maast’s utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak.

High doses of intravenously-delivered vector are required to reach the CNS, which has resulted in varying adverse effects.

To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids.

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) – two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphic workflowThe Figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license.",,10.1101/2022.07.04.498721,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498721v1,2022.07.04.498721,7/4/2022,,"Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna","Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",,,0.0,,

Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,10.1101/2022.07.01.498451,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498451v1,2022.07.01.498451,7/3/2022,,"Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology","Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

We hypothesized that phyllosphere interactions may be disrupted in a greenhouse setting, where microbial dispersal is limited, and that adding a microbial amendment might yield important benefits to the host plant.Using a newly developed synthetic phyllosphere microbiome for Tomato, we tested this hypothesis across multiple trials by manipulating microbial colonization of leaves and measuring subsequent plant growth and reproductive success, comparing results from plants grown in both greenhouse and field settings.We confirmed that greenhouse-grown plants have a depauperate phyllosphere microbiome and that the addition of the synthetic microbial community was responsible for a clear and repeatable increase in fruit production in this setting. We further show that this effect is synergistic with the addition of micronutrient-based soil amendments, with important implications for agriculture.These results suggest that greenhouse environments have poor phyllosphere microbiome establishment, with negative impacts on the plant. The results also implicate the phyllosphere microbiome as a key component of plant fitness, emphasizing that these communities have a clear role to play in the ecology and evolution of plant communities.",,10.1101/2022.06.30.498294,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498294v1,2022.06.30.498294,7/2/2022,,"Agricultural Research Service, Western Regional Research Center, Crop Improvement and Genetics Research Unit; Azomite Mineral Products, Inc.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Environmental Studies, Haverford College; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science; The Chopra Foundation; i-Cultiver, Inc.","Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Agricultural Research Service, Western Regional Research Center, Crop Improvement and Genetics Research Unit; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Environmental Studies, Haverford College; Azomite Mineral Products, Inc.; i-Cultiver, Inc.; i-Cultiver, Inc.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science; The Chopra Foundation; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments. Both cause metagenotype errors.This dilemma can be mitigated by leveraging paired-end reads, customizing databases to species detected in the sample, and adjusting post-alignment filters.",,10.1101/2022.06.30.498336,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498336v1,2022.06.30.498336,7/2/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology","Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California",,,0.0,Now published in Sci Rep 10.1038/s41598-022-14450-0.,3.0

A key component to this is that global transcription rates increase in larger cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we identify RNAPII as the major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size in budding yeast as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the general transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content. This drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is precisely compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge.

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation. Our findings reveal β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells implying a role of S1P1 signaling in remyelination.

One in five people (20.3 percent) across the fifty-six countries in our study had health insurance. Health insurance coverage exceeded 50 percent in only seven countries and 70 percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4 percent versus 28.6 percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege.

However, applying it to GPCRs without signaling proteins remains challenging because most receptors lack structural features in their soluble domains to facilitate image alignment. In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring different fusion protein designs, which lead to structures of antagonist bound A2A adenosine receptor at 3.4 Å resolution and unliganded Smoothened at 3.7 Å resolution. The fusion strategies explored here are likely applicable to cryo-EM interrogation of other GPCRs and small integral membrane proteins.",35902590.0,doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-32125-2.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9334595/,,,07/28/2022,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.3 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress.

A systematic understanding of host factors influencing viral infection is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation.

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones. Together, these results provide a comprehensive map of the cycling human breast.

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet-to-be-defined host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease.",35896747.0,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4,,,07/27/2022,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.5 Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.",,,2022 Jul 27.,1.0,,

We applied this approach to study the human proteasome from HEK cells and rapidly determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of major proteasomal complexes, including a high-resolution structure of intact human PA28αβ-20S.

While the cyclical processes of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration characterizing their life cycle have been documented previously, the cellular and molecular changes associated with such processes and their relationship with variation in brain morphology and individual (zooid) behavior throughout adult life remains unknown. Here, we introduce Botryllus schlosseri as an invertebrate model for neurogenesis, neural degeneration, and evolutionary neuroscience. Our analysis reveals that during the weekly colony budding (i.e., asexual reproduction), prior to programmed cell death and removal by phagocytes, decreases in the number of neurons in the adult brain are associated with reduced behavioral response and significant change in the expression of 73 mammalian homologous genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Similarly, when comparing young colonies (1 to 2 y of age) to those reared in a laboratory for ∼20 y, we found that older colonies contained significantly fewer neurons and exhibited reduced behavioral response alongside changes in the expression of 148 such genes (35 of which were differentially expressed across both timescales). The existence of two distinct yet apparently related neurodegenerative pathways represents a novel platform to study the gene products governing the relationship between aging, neural regeneration and degeneration, and loss of nervous system function. Indeed, as a member of an evolutionary clade considered to be a sister group of vertebrates, this organism may be a fundamental resource in understanding how evolution has shaped these processes across phylogeny and obtaining mechanistic insight.

57.0,8/3/2022,Lucy Erin O'Brien,Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol,Tissue Homeostasis and Non-Homeostasis: From Cell Life Cycles to Organ States,"Although tissue homeostasis-the steady state-implies stability, our organs are in a state of continual, large-scale cellular flux. This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.

Here we show that BET proteins should not be inactivated therapeutically because they are critical antiviral factors at the post-entry level. Depletion of BRD3 or BRD4 in cells overexpressing ACE2 exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infection; the same is observed when cells with endogenous ACE2 expression are treated with BET inhibitors during infection and not before. Viral replication and mortality are also enhanced in BET inhibitor-treated mice overexpressing ACE2. BET inactivation suppresses interferon production induced by SARS-CoV-2, a process phenocopied by the envelope (E) protein previously identified as a possible ""histone mimetic."" E protein, in an acetylated form, directly binds the second bromodomain of BRD4. Our data support a model where SARS-CoV-2 E protein evolved to antagonize interferon responses via BET protein inhibition; this neutralization should not be further enhanced with BET inhibitor treatment.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a recently established method for culture-independent LRTI diagnosis, but its utility for predicting AMR has remained unclear. We aimed to assess the performance of mNGS for AMR prediction in bacterial LRTI and demonstrate proof of concept for epidemiological AMR surveillance and rapid AMR gene detection using Cas9 enrichment and nanopore sequencing.              Methods:                    We studied 88 patients with acute respiratory failure between 07/2013 and 9/2018, enrolled through a previous observational study of LRTI. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory specimen collection within 72 h of intubation. Exclusion criteria were decline of study participation, unclear LRTI status, or no matched RNA and DNA mNGS data from a respiratory specimen. Patients with LRTI were identified by clinical adjudication. mNGS was performed on lower respiratory tract specimens. The primary outcome was mNGS performance for predicting phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and was assessed in patients with LRTI from culture-confirmed bacterial pathogens with clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing (n = 27 patients, n = 32 pathogens). Secondary outcomes included the association between hospital exposure and AMR gene burden in the respiratory microbiome (n = 88 patients), and AMR gene detection using Cas9 targeted enrichment and nanopore sequencing (n = 10 patients).              Results:                    Compared to clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the performance of respiratory mNGS for predicting AMR varied by pathogen, antimicrobial, and nucleic acid type sequenced. For gram-positive bacteria, a combination of RNA + DNA mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47-87%) and specificity of 95% (CI 85-99%). For gram-negative bacteria, sensitivity was 100% (CI 87-100%) and specificity 64% (CI 48-78%). Patients with hospital-onset LRTI had a greater AMR gene burden in their respiratory microbiome versus those with community-onset LRTI (p = 0.00030), or those without LRTI (p = 0.0024). We found that Cas9 targeted sequencing could enrich for low abundance AMR genes by > 2500-fold and enabled their rapid detection using a nanopore platform.              Conclusions:                    mNGS has utility for the detection and surveillance of resistant bacterial LRTI pathogens.",35818068.0,doi: 10.1186/s13073-022-01072-4.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9275031/,,,7/12/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 12;14(1):74.,0.0,,

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",35817986.0,doi: 10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01106-y,,,7/11/2022,"1 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.6 Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.9 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. pritch@stanford.edu.10 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.11 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.12 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.13 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.14 Diabetes Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.15 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.16 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.17 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.18 Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. alexander.marson@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 11.,0.0,,

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.",35803954.0,doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-31600-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9263813/,,,7/8/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.6 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.7 Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 8;13(1):3937.,0.0,,

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.

Recent genomic analyses have profoundly reshaped our understanding of the distribution and functionalities of Archaea and their roles in eukaryotic evolution.              Results:                    Here, 1179 representative genomes were selected from 3197 archaeal genomes. The representative genomes clustered based on the content of 10,866 newly defined archaeal protein families (that will serve as a community resource) recapitulates archaeal phylogeny. We identified the co-occurring proteins that distinguish the major lineages. Those with metabolic roles were consistent with experimental data. However, two families specific to Asgard were determined to be new eukaryotic signature proteins. Overall, the blocks of lineage-specific families are dominated by proteins that lack functional predictions.              Conclusions:                    Given that these hypothetical proteins are near ubiquitous within major archaeal groups, we propose that they were important in the origin of most of the major archaeal lineages. Interestingly, although there were clearly phylum-specific co-occurring proteins, no such blocks of protein families were shared across superphyla, suggesting a burst-like origin of new lineages early in archaeal evolution.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to determine whether physical activity independently associates with expression of inflammatory genes among people with RA.              Methods:                    This was a prospective observational study of adults with RA. Physical activity was measured by quantitative actigraphy over 7 consecutive days, and peripheral blood collected during the same time period was used for RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses.              Results:                    Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56±12 years, 91% female, 31% white, 9% African American, 9% Asian, 40% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj<0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.              Conclusion:                    RA patients who were more physically active had lower expression of immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, even after adjusting for disease activity, suggesting that physical activity may confer a protective effect in RA.",35777820.0,doi: 10.3899/jrheum.220050.,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.220050,,,7/1/2022,"1 Division of Rheumatology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Division of Infectious Diseases, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity. In summary, we provide an atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of epigenetic state can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.

A large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC. Advanced polyps contain increasing numbers of stem-like cells, regulatory T cells and a subtype of pre-cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the cancerous state, we observe T cell exhaustion, RUNX1-regulated cancer-associated fibroblasts and increasing accessibility associated with HNF4A motifs in epithelia.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.

While we can alter an organoid's morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid's morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer.",35637349.0,doi: 10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3,,5/30/2022,2022-07,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.4 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.5 Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.11 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.12 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.13 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.14 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.15 Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Jul;18(7):751-761.,0.0,,

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting.

Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.",35584773.0,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04865-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9279157/,,5/18/2022,2022-07,"1 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.7 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Michael Hulton Center for HIV Cure Research at Gladstone, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, USA.11 Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.12 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.13 Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.14 Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.15 California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.16 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.17 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.18 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.19 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.20 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.21 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.22 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.23 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.24 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.25 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.26 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.27 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.28 Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.29 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.30 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.31 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.32 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.33 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul;607(7918):351-355.,0.0,,

Methods:                    Serum and CSF were screened by tissue-based assay and panned for candidate autoantibodies by phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq). The candidate antigen was validated by immunostaining knockout tissue and HEK 293T cell-based assay.              Results:                    Case 1 presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias after a recent diagnosis of serous uterine and fallopian carcinoma. Case 2 had a remote history of breast adenocarcinoma and presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias that progressed to generalized weakness. CSF and serum from both patients immunostained the axon initial segment (AIS) and node of Ranvier (NoR) of mice and enriched βIV-spectrin by PhIP-Seq. Patient CSF and serum failed to immunostain NoRs in dorsal root sensory neurons from βI/βIV-deficient mice. βIV-spectrin autoantibodies were confirmed by overexpression of AIS and nodal βIV-spectrin isoforms Σ1 and Σ6 by a cell-based assay. βIV-spectrin was not enriched in a combined 4,815 PhIP-Seq screens of healthy and other neurologic disease patients.

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency. This study sheds light on the role of co-occurring genetic alterations and on the effect of splicing factor deficiency on the modulation of sensitivity to targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapy.

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physicochemical data and 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize the sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 30% of those currently known, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. 16S rRNA gene amplicon screening of 224 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs retrieved from a single site are representative of the microbial community in the vent field sediments. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison between Auka MAGs and MAGs from Guaymas Basin revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap, suggestive of long-distance species transfer over 400 km and subsequent sediment colonization. Optimal growth temperature prediction on the Auka MAGs, and thousands of reference genomes, shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.

Mouse cytomegalovirus infection triggers NK receptor-induced, ligand-specific IL-12-dependent NK cell expansion, yet specific IL-12 stimulation ex vivo leading to NK cell proliferation and expansion is not established. Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion. These findings demonstrate that activating NK receptor stimulation promotes differential IL-12 signaling, leading to human NK cell expansion, and suggest adopting strategies to provide IL-12 signaling in vivo for ligand-specific IL-2-primed NK cell-based therapies.",35758909.0,doi: 10.1084/jem.20212434.,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20212434,,06/27/2022,08/01/2022,"1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.2 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA.3 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.4 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.6 Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.7 University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.",,,2022 Aug 1;219(8):e20212434.,1.0,,

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.              Methods:                    Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.              Results:                    Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.              Interpretation:                    Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.

However, applying it to GPCRs without signaling proteins remains challenging because most receptors lack structural features in their soluble domains to facilitate image alignment. In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring different fusion protein designs, which lead to structures of antagonist bound A2A adenosine receptor at 3.4 Å resolution and unliganded Smoothened at 3.7 Å resolution. The fusion strategies explored here are likely applicable to cryo-EM interrogation of other GPCRs and small integral membrane proteins.",35902590.0,10.1038/s41467-022-32125-2.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9334595/,,,07/28/2022,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.3 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.

Using a commercial OCT device, we demonstrate 3D reconstruction of microarchitectural elements through a cortical column. Our system is sensitive to structural and cellular changes at micron-scale resolution in vivo, such as those from injury or disease. Therefore, it can serve as a tool to visualize and quantify spatiotemporal brain elasticity patterns.

Recently, several papers have called into question the performance of lattice light sheets relative to the Gaussian sheets most common in light sheet microscopy. Here we undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of various forms of light sheet microscopy which both demonstrates and explains why lattice light sheets provide significant improvements in resolution and photobleaching reduction. The analysis provides a procedure to select the correct light sheet for a desired experiment and specifies the processing that maximizes the use of all fluorescence generated within the light sheet excitation envelope for optimal resolution while minimizing image artifacts and photodamage. Development of a new type of “harmonic balanced” lattice light sheet is shown to improve performance at all spatial frequencies within its 3D resolution limits and maintains this performance over lengthened propagation distances allowing for expanded fields of view.Significance Statement Despite its rapidly growing use, several misconceptions remain concerning the physics of image formation and its optimization in light sheet microscopy, particularly in high resolution variants tailored for subcellular imaging. These include the role of excitation sidelobes, the significance of out-of-focus fluorescence, the importance and optimization of deconvolution, and the perceived advantages of Gaussian beams. Here we attempt to shatter these misconceptions by showing that the professed tradeoffs between axial resolution and background haze, photobleaching rate, phototoxicity, and propensity for image artifacts do not exist for well-crafted lattice light sheets whose data is acquired and processed rigorously.
