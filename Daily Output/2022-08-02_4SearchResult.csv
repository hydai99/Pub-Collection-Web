Recently, several papers have called into question the performance of lattice light sheets relative to the Gaussian sheets most common in light sheet microscopy. Here we undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of various forms of light sheet microscopy which both demonstrates and explains why lattice light sheets provide significant improvements in resolution and photobleaching reduction. The analysis provides a procedure to select the correct light sheet for a desired experiment and specifies the processing that maximizes the use of all fluorescence generated within the light sheet excitation envelope for optimal resolution while minimizing image artifacts and photodamage. Development of a new type of “harmonic balanced” lattice light sheet is shown to improve performance at all spatial frequencies within its 3D resolution limits and maintains this performance over lengthened propagation distances allowing for expanded fields of view.Significance Statement Despite its rapidly growing use, several misconceptions remain concerning the physics of image formation and its optimization in light sheet microscopy, particularly in high resolution variants tailored for subcellular imaging. These include the role of excitation sidelobes, the significance of out-of-focus fluorescence, the importance and optimization of deconvolution, and the perceived advantages of Gaussian beams. Here we attempt to shatter these misconceptions by showing that the professed tradeoffs between axial resolution and background haze, photobleaching rate, phototoxicity, and propensity for image artifacts do not exist for well-crafted lattice light sheets whose data is acquired and processed rigorously. The framework we provide should enable others to optimize light sheets and extract the most information at the lowest cost in their experiments.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502108,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502108v1,2022.07.30.502108,07/30/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Physics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Department of Physics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0

CRISPR screens have nominated gene targets for engineered T cells, but improved methods are required to compare large numbers of synthetic knockin sequences to reprogram cell functions. Here, we developed Modular Pooled Knockin Screening (ModPoKI), an adaptable platform for modular construction of DNA knockin libraries using barcoded multicistronic adaptors. We built two ModPoKI libraries of 100 transcription factors (TFs) and 129 natural and synthetic surface receptors. Over 20 ModPoKI screens across human TCR and CAR T cells in diverse conditions identified a transcription factor AP4 (TFAP4) construct to enhance long-term T cell fitness and anti-cancer function in vitro and in vivo. ModPoKI’s modularity allowed us to generate a ∼10,000-member library of TF combinations. Non-viral knockin of a combined BATF-TFAP4 polycistronic construct further enhanced function in vivo. ModPoKI facilitates discovery of complex gene constructs to program cellular functions.HighlightsModular pooled knockins of hundreds of TF and surface receptor constructs combined with different antigen receptorsChronic stimulation screens discover programs to improve T cell persistenceCombinatorial knockin screens with ∼10,000 transcription factor combinationsBATF-TFAP4 dual knockin construct improves CAR T cell function in vitro and in vivo",,10.1101/2022.07.27.501186,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.27.501186v1,2022.07.27.501186,07/27/2022,,"Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Department of Pediatric Hematology; Diabetes Center, University of California; Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital, University Hospital; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Munich; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California; Institute for Human Genetics (IHG), University of California; National Center for Infection Research (DZIF); Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California","Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Institute for Human Genetics (IHG), University of California; Institute for Human Genetics (IHG), University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Diabetes Center, University of California; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California; Department of Pediatric Hematology; Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital, University Hospital; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Munich; National Center for Infection Research (DZIF); Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California; Institute for Human Genetics (IHG), University of California; Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Medicine, University of California; Institute for Human Genetics (IHG), University of California; Diabetes Center, University of California; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California",,,0

Here we provide a single nucleus and single cell RNA-seq resource covering all of spermatogenesis in Drosophila starting from in-depth analysis of adult testis single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from the Fly Cell Atlas (FCA) study (Li et al., 2022). With over 44,000 nuclei and 6,000 cells analyzed, the data provide identification of rare cell types, mapping of intermediate steps in differentiation, and the potential to identify new factors impacting fertility or controlling differentiation of germline and supporting somatic cells. We justify assignment of key germline and somatic cell types using combinations of known markers, in situ hybridization, and analysis of extant protein traps. Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation. To complement the web-based portals for data analysis hosted by the FCA, we provide datasets compatible with commonly used software such as Seurat and Monocle.

In response, cells mount complex responses across multiple scales, including adjusting their shape to withstand stress. In enterobacteria, the Rcs phosphorelay is activated by cell envelope damage and by changes to periplasmic dimensions and cell width. Here, we investigated the physiological and morphological consequences of Rcs activation in Escherichia coli in the absence of stresses, using an inducible version of RcsF that mislocalizes to the inner membrane, RcsFIM. Expression of RcsFIM immediately reduced cellular growth rate and the added length per cell cycle in a manner that was directly dependent on induction levels, but independent of Rcs-induced capsule production. At the same time, cells increased intracellular concentration of the cell division protein FtsZ, and decreased the distance between division rings in filamentous cells. Depletion of the Rcs negative regulator IgaA phenocopied RcsFIM induction, indicating that IgaA is essential due to growth inhibition in its absence. However, A22 treatment did not affect growth rate or FtsZ intracellular concentration, despite activating the Rcs system. These findings suggest that the effect of Rcs activation on FtsZ levels is mediated indirectly through growth-rate changes, and highlight feedbacks among the Rcs stress response, growth dynamics, and cell-size control.",,10.1101/2022.07.26.501648,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501648v1,2022.07.26.501648,07/27/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0

In Escherichia coli, the Rcs system is required to survive A22 and mecillinam treatment, two drugs that perturb cell size. To test whether cell size changes might be correlated with envelope damage and thereby sensed by the Rcs system, we tuned E. coli cell size via drug inhibition with A22, point mutations to the cell-shape determinant MreB, and mechanically confined growth. In all conditions, cell width was strongly correlated with Rcs activation, with wider cells exhibiting more activation than wild-type. In all conditions, RcsF, the outer membrane-localized upstream component of the Rcs system, was essential for responding to cell width changes. Consistently, several envelope gene deletions known to induce the Rcs system via RcsF resulted in cells that were wider than wild-type. Cryo- electron microscopy revealed that the periplasm of a wide MreB mutant was on average ∼3 nm thinner than wild-type, thereby bringing RcsF closer to the downstream components of the signaling cascade in the inner membrane. Conversely, extending the flexible linker region of RcsF by ∼3 nm increased Rcs activity in wild-type cells. In summary, we propose that the Rcs system responds to changes in cell width because of altered periplasmic thickness.",,10.1101/2022.07.26.501644,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501644v1,2022.07.26.501644,07/27/2022,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford; Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Molecular Sociology, Max Planck Institute of Biophysics,; Electron Microscopy Core Facility; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; India; School of Arts and Sciences, Azim Premji University; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Walloon Excellence in Life sciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO); de Duve Institute, UCLouvain","Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford; Department of Molecular Sociology, Max Planck Institute of Biophysics,; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford; Walloon Excellence in Life sciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO); de Duve Institute, UCLouvain; School of Arts and Sciences, Azim Premji University; India; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Electron Microscopy Core Facility; Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania; de Duve Institute, UCLouvain; Walloon Excellence in Life sciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO); Department of Molecular Sociology, Max Planck Institute of Biophysics,; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Structural and Computational Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg",,,0

Using bioinformatics and chemoproteomics, we identify serine hydrolases in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that are specific to the Bacteroidetes phylum. Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling. Functional studies reveal that BT4193 is a true homolog of hDPP4 while the other is misannotated and is a proline-specific triaminopeptidase. We demonstrate that BT4193 is important for envelope integrity and is inhibited by FDA-approved type 2 diabetes drugs that target hDPP4. Loss of BT4193 reduces B. thetaiotaomicron fitness during in vitro growth within a diverse community.

In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression.

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

We leverage multiple published datasets to show that Scriabin recovers expected CCC edges and use spatial transcriptomic data, genetic perturbation screens, and direct experimental manipulation of receptor-ligand interactions to validate that the recovered edges are biologically meaningful. We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of CCC from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Health insurance coverage exceeded 50 percent in only seven countries and 70 percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4 percent versus 28.6 percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege.

Using a commercial OCT device, we demonstrate 3D reconstruction of microarchitectural elements through a cortical column. Our system is sensitive to structural and cellular changes at micron-scale resolution in vivo, such as those from injury or disease. Therefore, it can serve as a tool to visualize and quantify spatiotemporal brain elasticity patterns. This highly transformative and versatile platform allows accurate investigation of brain cellular architectural changes by quantifying features such as brain cell bodies' density, volume, and average distance to the nearest cell.

However, applying it to GPCRs without signaling proteins remains challenging because most receptors lack structural features in their soluble domains to facilitate image alignment. In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring different fusion protein designs, which lead to structures of antagonist bound A2A adenosine receptor at 3.4 Å resolution and unliganded Smoothened at 3.7 Å resolution. The fusion strategies explored here are likely applicable to cryo-EM interrogation of other GPCRs and small integral membrane proteins.",35902590,doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-32125-2.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9334595/,,,07/28/2022,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.3 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease.",35896747,doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4,,,07/27/2022,"1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.5 Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hitenmadhani@gmail.com.",,,2022 Jul 27.,0

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Disruption of both mTOR complexes leads to pronounced deficits in dopamine release demonstrating the importance of balanced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling for dopaminergic function.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet-to-be-defined host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.

Mouse cytomegalovirus infection triggers NK receptor-induced, ligand-specific IL-12-dependent NK cell expansion, yet specific IL-12 stimulation ex vivo leading to NK cell proliferation and expansion is not established. Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion. These findings demonstrate that activating NK receptor stimulation promotes differential IL-12 signaling, leading to human NK cell expansion, and suggest adopting strategies to provide IL-12 signaling in vivo for ligand-specific IL-2-primed NK cell-based therapies.",35758909,doi: 10.1084/jem.20212434.,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20212434,,06/27/2022,08/01/2022,"1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.2 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA.3 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.4 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.6 Gladstone University of California, San Francisco Institute for Genetic Immunology, San Francisco, CA.7 University of California, San Francisco Cell Design Institute, San Francisco, CA.",,,2022 Aug 1;219(8):e20212434.,0

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.              Methods:                    Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.              Results:                    Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.              Interpretation:                    Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.

These atlases provide a basic understanding of how different cell types of the same organism - which all share the genome - make distinct use of subsets of genes from the genome to create a variety of distinct cell types across tissues with specialized functions. In this opinion article I discuss some of the history and technological innovations that led to the development of whole-organism atlases.",35105475,doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2022.01.004.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2022.01.004,,01/31/2022,2022-08,"1 Stanford University and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, 318 Campus Dr., Stanford, CA 94305, USA.
