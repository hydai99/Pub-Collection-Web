Pollard",biorxiv,A novel in silico method employs chemical and protein similarity algorithms to accurately identify chemical transformations in the human gut microbiome,"Bacteria within the gut microbiota possess the ability to metabolize a wide array of human drugs, foods, and toxins, but the responsible enzymes for these chemical events remain largely uncharacterized due to the time consuming nature of current experimental approaches. Attempts have been made in the past to computationally predict which bacterial species and enzymes are responsible for chemical transformations in the gut environment, but with low accuracy due to minimal chemical representation and sequence similarity search schemes. Here, we present an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER). We show that SIMMER predicts the chemistry and responsible species and enzymes for a queried reaction with high accuracy, unlike previous methods. We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug transformations known to occur in the human gut. Bacterial species containing these enzymes are enriched within human donor stool samples that metabolize the query compound. After demonstrating its utility and accuracy, we chose to make SIMMER available as both a command-line and web tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical transformations within the human gut. We present SIMMER as a computational addition to the microbiome researcher’s toolbox, enabling them to make informed hypotheses before embarking on the lengthy laboratory experiments required to characterize novel bacterial enzymes that can alter human ingested compounds.",,10.1101/2022.08.02.502504,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.02.502504v1,2022.08.02.502504,08/04/2022,,"Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes; Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics Graduate Program, University of California","Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics Graduate Program, University of California; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California",,,1.0,,

It is unknown how dietary changes influence liver homeostasis. Here, we show that a switch from ad libitum feeding to intermittent fasting, IF, promotes rapid hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat. This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.",,10.1101/2021.10.16.464650,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.16.464650v2,2021.10.16.464650,08/03/2022,,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine","Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection. These data demonstrate the functionality of ACE2-OE organoids in SARS-CoV-2 research and identify an incomplete NF-κB feedback loop as a rheostat of viral infection that may promote inflammation and severe disease.",,10.1101/2022.08.02.502100,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.02.502100v1,2022.08.02.502100,08/02/2022,,"Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California San Francisco; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine and Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Systems Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Gladstone Institute of Virology; ImmunoX CoLabs, University of California San Francisco; Medical Scientist Training Program, University of California San Francisco; Medical Service, San Francisco VA Healthcare System","Gladstone Institute of Virology; Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California San Francisco; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Medical Scientist Training Program, University of California San Francisco; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Gladstone Institute of Virology; ImmunoX CoLabs, University of California San Francisco; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Medical Service, San Francisco VA Healthcare System; Department of Medicine and Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine and Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine and Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Medical Service, San Francisco VA Healthcare System; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Center for Computational Biology, University of California; Department of Systems Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science; Gladstone Institute of Virology; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco",,,1.0,,

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.Methods The gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.Results Variation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.Conclusions The observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502150,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502150v1,2022.07.30.502150,08/02/2022,,"Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine","Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation. Our findings reveal β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells implying a role of S1P1 signaling in remyelination.

While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs.

We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502752,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502752v1,2022.08.04.502752,08/05/2022,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University","Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Chemistry, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging",,,0.0,,

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.
