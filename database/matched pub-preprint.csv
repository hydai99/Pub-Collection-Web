In response to infection by its viral host ICP1, PLE excises, replicates and hijacks ICP1 structural components for transduction. Through an unknown mechanism, PLE prevents ICP1 from transitioning to rolling circle replication (RCR), a prerequisite for efficient packaging of the viral genome. Here, we characterize a PLE-encoded nuclease, NixI, that blocks phage development likely by nicking ICP1's genome as it transitions to RCR. NixI-dependent cleavage sites appear in ICP1's genome during infection of PLE(+) V. cholerae. Purified NixI demonstrates in vitro nuclease activity specifically for sites in ICP1's genome and we identify a motif that is necessary for NixI-mediated cleavage. Importantly, NixI is sufficient to limit ICP1 genome replication and eliminate progeny production, representing the most inhibitory PLE-encoded mechanism revealed to date. We identify distant NixI homologs in an expanded family of putative phage parasites in vibrios that lack nucleotide homology to PLEs but nonetheless share genomic synteny with PLEs.

While we know nearly all mammalian kinetochore proteins, how these give rise to the strong yet dynamic microtubule attachments required for function remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the Astrin-SKAP complex, which localizes to bioriented kinetochores and is essential for chromosome segregation but whose mechanical role is unclear. Live imaging reveals that SKAP depletion dampens the movement and decreases the coordination of metaphase sister kinetochores and increases the tension between them. Using laser ablation to isolate kinetochores bound to polymerizing versus depolymerizing microtubules, we show that without SKAP, kinetochores move slower on both polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules and that more force is needed to rescue microtubules to polymerize. Thus, in contrast to the previously described kinetochore proteins that increase the grip on microtubules under force, Astrin-SKAP reduces the grip, increasing attachment dynamics and force responsiveness and reducing friction.

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, Acj6 controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.",Drosophila; Piezo; antennal lobe; cell-surface protein; combinatorial code; dendrite targeting; olfactory circuit; proteome; transcription factor; wiring specificity,,,,,2022-05-26 00:00:00,2022/05/24,2022/5/26,Qijing Xie; Jiefu Li; Hongjie Li; Namrata D Udeshi; Tanya Svinkina; Daniel Orlin; Sayeh Kohani; Ricardo Guajardo; D R Mani; Chuanyun Xu; Tongchao Li; Shuo Han; Wei Wei; S Andrew Shuster; David J Luginbuhl; Stephen R Quake; Swetha E Murthy; Alice Y Ting; Steven A Carr; Liqun Luo,,"Department of Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Here, we created a CRISPRi library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain 3610. We show that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. We developed an image analysis algorithm to quantify biofilm colony wrinkling, which identified strains with high or low levels of wrinkling that were uncorrelated with extracellular matrix gene expression. We also designed a high-throughput screen for sensitive quantification of sporulation efficiency and performed the first screens of sporulation during essential gene knockdown. We found that all basal knockdowns of essential genes were competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but certain strains exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased wrinkling and inhibited sporulation. These results highlight the importance of essential genes in biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes.

Abstract ImportanceFor many bacteria, life typically involves growth in dense, three-dimensional communities called biofilms that contain cells with differentiated roles and are held together by extracellular matrix. To examine how gene function varies between non-biofilm and biofilm growth, we created a comprehensive library of strains using CRISPRi to knockdown expression of each essential gene in the model species Bacillus subtilis 3610, which can develop into a wrinkled biofilm structure or a spore capable of surviving harsh environments. This library enabled us to determine when gene essentiality depends on growth conditions. We also developed high-throughput assays and computational algorithms to identify essential genes involved in biofilm wrinkling and sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased the density of wrinkles, and also inhibited sporulation in a medium with generally lower sporulation levels. These findings indicate that essential processes such as fatty acid synthesis can play important and multifaceted roles in bacterial development.",,,biorxiv;2022.05.31.494136,1.0,new results,2022-05-31 00:00:00,05/31/2022,,Heidi A.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer.",,,,,,2022-06-01 00:00:00,2022/05/30,2022/6/1,Zhipeng Li;

Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDM generation; however, it is unclear if inter-individual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here, we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals.

How TMEM95 plays a role in membrane fusion of sperm and eggs has remained elusive. Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino-acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for a specific, receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs and suggest that this interaction may have a role in facilitating membrane fusion.

Significance statementMembrane fusion of sperm and eggs is pivotal in sexual reproduction. Tmem95 knockout mice show male-specific sterility, but it was unknown how sperm TMEM95 facilitates membrane fusion with eggs. We show here that human TMEM95 binds eggs. Our crystal structure of TMEM95 suggests a region where this binding may occur. We develop monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that impair sperm-egg fusion but do not block sperm-egg binding. Thus, we propose that there is a receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs, and that this interaction may have a direct role in membrane fusion. Our work suggests avenues for the identification of the TMEM95 egg receptor and may enable the development of infertility treatments and contraceptives for humans.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.10.495573,1.0,new results,2022-06-10 00:00:00,06/10/2022,,Shaogeng Tang; Yonggang Lu; Will M.

While some cell size control mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated through studies of cultured cells, it is unclear if and how such mechanisms control cell size in an animal. For example, it was recently shown that RB, the retinoblastoma protein, was diluted by cell growth in G1 to promote size-dependence of the G1/S transition. However, it remains unclear to what extent the RB-dilution mechanism controls cell size in an animal. We therefore examined the contribution of RB-dilution to cell size control in the mouse liver. The RB-dilution model has two requirements. First, manipulations changing RB concentration drive corresponding changes in cell size, and second, the endogenous RB concentration decreases with cell size in G1. We found that both these requirements were met. Genetic perturbations decreasing RB protein concentrations through inducible shRNA expression or through liverspecific Rb1 knockout reduced hepatocyte size, while perturbations increasing RB protein concentrations in an Fah-/- mouse model increased hepatocyte size. Moreover, RB concentration decreased in larger G1 hepatocytes while the concentrations of the cell cycle activators Cyclin D1 and E2f1 remained relatively constant. Lastly, we tested how Rb1 manipulations affected G1/S cell size control in primary hepatocytes using live cell imaging. Loss of Rb1 weakened cell size control, i.e., reduced the inverse correlation between how much cells grew in G1 and how large they were at birth. Taken together, our results show that an RB- dilution mechanism contributes to cell size control in the mouse liver by linking cell growth to the G1/S transition.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.08.495371,1.0,new results,2022-06-10 00:00:00,06/10/2022,,Shuyuan Zhang; Evgeny Zatulovskiy; Julia Arand; Julien Sage; Jan M.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

The anterior of the cell is marked by an array of cilia, known as the oral apparatus, which can be induced to shed and regenerate in a series of reproducible morphological steps, previously shown to require transcription. If a cell is cut in half, each half will regenerate an intact cell, including a new oral apparatus in the posterior half. We used RNAseq to assay the dynamic changes in Stentors transcriptome during regeneration, after both oral apparatus shedding and bisection, allowing us to identify distinct temporal waves of gene expression including kinases, RNA binding proteins, centriole biogenesis factors, and orthologs of human ciliopathy genes implicated in Meckel and Joubert syndromes. By comparing transcriptional profiles of different regeneration events in the same species, we were able to identify distinct modules of gene expression corresponding to oral apparatus regeneration, posterior holdfast regeneration, and recovery after wounding. By measuring gene expression in cells in which translation is blocked, we show that the sequential waves of gene expression involve a cascade mechanism in which later waves of expression are triggered by translation products of early-expressed genes. Among the early-expressed genes, we identified an E2F transcription factor and the conserved RNA binding protein Pumilio as potential regulators of regeneration based on the expression pattern of their predicted target genes. RNAi mediated knockdown experiments indicate that Pumilio is required for regenerating oral structures of the correct size. We show that E2F is involved in the completion of regeneration but is dispensable for earlier steps. This work allows us to classify regeneration genes into groups based on their potential role for regeneration in distinct cell regeneration paradigms, and provides insight into how a single cell can coordinate complex morphogenetic pathways to regenerate missing structures.",,,biorxiv;2021.06.23.449623,3.0,new results,2022-06-19 00:00:00,06/19/2022,,Pranidhi Sood; Athena Lin; Connie Yan; Rebecca McGillivary; Ulises Diaz; Tatyana Makushok; Wallace F.

To inform Lesothos national rollout of PrEP to the general population, this research aimed to characterize knowledge and attitudes towards PrEP among policy makers, implementing partners, healthcare providers, and PrEP end-users in Lesotho. Respondents were purposively selected to participate based on personal experience in the development and implementation of Lesothos PrEP program, or the personal use of PrEP. We conducted 106 in-depth interviews with policy makers (n=5), implementing partners (n=4), and end-users (current PrEP users = 55; former PrEP users = 36; and PrEP ""decliners"" = 6). In addition, we held 11 focus group discussions (FGDs) with a total of 105 healthcare providers. Interview and FGD transcripts were analyzed following the tenets of Grounded Theory. Respondents expressed positive attitudes towards PrEP, owing to experienced and perceived personal, familial, and societal benefits. PrEP was viewed as i) an opportunity for serodiscordant couples to remain together, ii) a means of conceiving children with minimized risk of HIV infection, iii) providing a sense of agency and control, and iv) an avenue for addressing the HIV epidemic in Lesotho. Respondents demonstrated understanding of PrEPs intended use, eligibility requirements, and modality of use. However, they also reported that several important misconceptions of PrEP were common among adults in Lesotho, including the belief that PrEP protects against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, promotes promiscuity, prevents pregnancy, causes seroconversion, and provides lifelong protection from taking the pill just once. In addition to building on the perceived advantages of PrEP to shape a positive message, Lesothos national rollout of PrEP will likely benefit from a communication strategy that specifically addresses the common misconceptions of PrEP identified in this study.",,,medrxiv;2022.06.21.22276722,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-06-22 00:00:00,06/22/2022,,Pascal Geldsetzer; Joy J.

VPS13A and VPS13C localize to multiple organelle contact sites, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - lipid droplet (LD) contact sites, but the functional roles of these proteins in LD regulation remains mostly unexplored. Here, we employ CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate VPS13A and VPS13C knockout cell lines in U-2 OS cells via deletion of exon 2 and introduction of an early frameshift. Analysis of LD content in these cell lines revealed that loss of either VPS13A or VPS13C results in reduced LD abundance under oleate-stimulated conditions.

These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the near-complete 16,740 nt genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses--HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)--but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the viruss potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover.

ImportanceHenipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus which likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.12.495793,2.0,new results,2022-06-24 00:00:00,06/24/2022,,Sharline Madera; Amy Kistler; Hafaliana C.

Using synthetic biology, we engineered T cells with a chimeric receptor SyNthetic Intramembrane Proteolysis Receptor (SNIPR) that induces overexpression of an exogenous reporter gene cassette upon recognition of specific tumor markers. We then applied a SNIPR-based positron emission tomography (PET) reporter system to two cancer-relevant antigens, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), commonly expressed in breast and glial tumors respectively. Antigen-specific reporter induction of the SNIPR-PET T cells was confirmed in vitro using GFP fluorescence, luciferase luminescence, and the HSV-TK PET reporter with [18F]FHBG. T cells associated with their target antigens were successfully imaged using PET in dual xenograft HER2+/HER2- and EGFRvIII+/EGFRvIII-animal models, with > 10-fold higher [18F]FHBG signals seen in antigen-expressing tumors versus the corresponding controls.

When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.",Arp2/3 complex; actin; amoeboid motility; cell biology; cell mechanics; cytoskeleton; force generation; load adaptation; none,,,,,2022-06-25 00:00:00,2022/06/24,2022/6/25,Tai-De Li; Peter Bieling; Julian Weichsel; R Dyche Mullins; Daniel A Fletcher,,"Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Advanced Science Research Center, City University of New York, New York, United States.; Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Systemic Cell Biology, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany.","Tai-De Li: Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Advanced Science Research Center, City University of New York, New York, United States.Peter Bieling: Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Systemic Cell Biology, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany.Julian Weichsel: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.R Dyche Mullins: Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.Daniel A Fletcher: Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.",,,10.1101/2021.05.24.445507,,,0

To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids. We identified the amino acid (aa) from region 451-470 of AAV2 associated with the capsids selected for neurons, and a combination of aa from regions 413-496 of AAV-rh10 and 538-598 of AAV3B/LK03 associated with capsids selected for astrocytes. An siRNA screen identified several genes that affect transcytosis of AAV across the BBB. Our work supports the use of a human transwell system for selecting enhanced AAV capsids targeting the CNS and may allow for unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms of BBB penetration.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.06.498990,1.0,new results,2022-07-06 00:00:00,07/06/2022,,Ren Song; Katja Pekrun; Themasap A.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.",Zika virus; centrosome; innate immunity; microcephaly,,,,,2022-07-07 00:00:00,2022/07/06,2022/7/7,Andrew Kodani; Kristeene A Knopp; Elizabeth Di Lullo; Hanna Retallack; Arnold R Kriegstein; Joseph L DeRisi; Jeremy F Reiter,,"Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Center for Pediatric Neurological Disease Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.; Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Andrew Kodani: Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Center for Pediatric Neurological Disease Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.Kristeene A Knopp: Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Elizabeth Di Lullo: Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Hanna Retallack: Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Arnold R Kriegstein: Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Joseph L DeRisi: Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Jeremy F Reiter: Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,10.1101/2020.09.15.298083,,,0

Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection.

Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.16.500284,1.0,new results,2022-07-16 00:00:00,07/16/2022,,Brent Townshend; Matias Kaplan; Christina D.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3 s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.15.499945,1.0,new results,2022-07-16 00:00:00,07/16/2022,,Amos J.

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases. In summary, our findings suggest that integrating host transcriptional profiling and broad-range metagenomic pathogen detection from nucleic acid may hold promise as a tool for sepsis diagnosis.",,,medrxiv;2022.07.16.22277700,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-07-17 00:00:00,07/17/2022,,Katrina Kalantar; Lucile Neyton; Mazin Abdelghany; Eran Mick; Alejandra Jauregui; Saharai Caldera; Paula Hayakawa Serpa; Rajani Ghale; Jack Albright; Aartik Sarma; Alexandra Tsitsiklis; Aleksandra Leligdowicz; Stephanie Christenson; Kathleen Liu; Kirsten Kangelaris; Carolyn Hendrickson; Pratik Sinha; Antonio Gomez; Norma Neff; Angela Pisco; Sarah Doernberg; Joseph L.

In this work we combined single cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing to better understand fate-choice in human B cells. Using the antibody sequence to trace cell lineage during in vitro differentiation, we identified intrinsic proliferative and cell fate biases of B cell subtypes. Clonal analysis revealed that IgM memory B cells were more proliferative than any other B cell subtype, and that cells from the same clone had highly concordant fates. We found that transcriptional memory within clones varies across genes, with strongest persistence in genes related to cell fate determination. Similar persistent transcriptional programs were observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, suggesting that these programs maintain long-term cell fate in vivo.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.","

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells.

Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.",Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; virus-like particles,,,,,2022-07-21 00:00:00,2022/07/19,2022/7/21,Abdullah M Syed; Alison Ciling; Taha Y Taha; Irene P Chen; Mir M Khalid; Bharath Sreekumar; Pei-Yi Chen; G Renuka Kumar; Rahul Suryawanshi; Ines Silva; Bilal Milbes; Noah Kojima; Victoria Hess; Maria Shacreaw; Lauren Lopez; Matthew Brobeck; Fred Turner; Lee Spraggon; Takako Tabata; Melanie Ott; Jennifer A Doudna,,"Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.; Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; HHMI, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232.","Abdullah M Syed: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.Alison Ciling: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.Taha Y Taha: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Irene P Chen: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.Mir M Khalid: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Bharath Sreekumar: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Pei-Yi Chen: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232.G Renuka Kumar: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Rahul Suryawanshi: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Ines Silva: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Bilal Milbes: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Noah Kojima: Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.Victoria Hess: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Maria Shacreaw: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Lauren Lopez: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Matthew Brobeck: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Fred Turner: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Lee Spraggon: Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, 91773.Takako Tabata: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.Melanie Ott: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.Jennifer A Doudna: Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; HHMI, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.",,,10.1101/2021.12.20.21268048,,,0

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones. Together, these results provide a comprehensive map of the cycling human breast.",cell-cell interactions; hormone signaling; human breast; sample heterogeneity; scRNA-seq; single-cell genomics,,,,,2022-07-22 00:00:00,2022/07/20,2022/7/22,Lyndsay M Murrow; Robert J Weber; Joseph A Caruso; Christopher S McGinnis; Kiet Phong; Philippe Gascard; Gabrielle Rabadam; Alexander D Borowsky; Tejal A Desai; Matthew Thomson; Thea Tlsty; Zev J Gartner,,"Center for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95696, USA.; Computational Biology, Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Pathology and Helen Diller Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, CT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7--corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap--then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude. These results suggest that our EIS smart bone plate can provide continuous and highly sensitive quantitative tissue measurements throughout the course of fracture healing to better guide personalized clinical care.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.23.501237,1.0,new results,2022-07-23 00:00:00,07/23/2022,,Naomasa Fukase; Victoria Duke; Monica C.

ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-{kappa}B inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more I{kappa}B expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B that I{kappa}B usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable I{kappa}B mutant reduced NF-{kappa}B translocation and increased viral infection.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",,,,,,2022-08-16 00:00:00,2022/08/15,2022/8/16,Takayoshi Shirasaki;

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS. These results open up exciting new avenues for improving picoscale droplet RT-PCR reactions and expanding microfluidic droplet based single-cell analysis technologies.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.16.504154,1.0,new results,2022-08-17 00:00:00,08/17/2022,,Margarita Khariton; Conor J.

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.

MethodsWe collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.

ResultsAmong 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples. Among 1,321 RT-PCR positive samples, 938/1321 (71%) were detected by BinaxNOW; 95% (774/817) of those with Ct value <30 were detected by BinaxNOW. BinaxNOW detection was consistent over lineages. In analyses to evaluate entry to treatment, BinaxNOW detected 82.7% (410/496, 95% CI: 79-86%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In comparison, RT-PCR (24-hour turnaround) detected 83.1% (412/496 95% CI: 79-86%) and RT-PCR (48-hour turnaround) detected 66.3% (329/496 95% CI: 62-70%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW detected high viral load from anterior nasal swabs consistently across omicron sublineages emerging between January and June of 2022. Simulations support BinaxNOW as an entry point for COVID-19 treatment in a community field setting.",,,medrxiv;2022.08.17.22278913,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-08-18 00:00:00,08/18/2022,,John Schrom; Carina Marquez; Chung-Yu Wang; Aditi Saxena; Anthea M.

ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy.

This matrix is estimated from fluxes between communities, obtained from cell-phone tracking data recorded in the USA between March 2020 and February 2021. We apply this model to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by fitting just one global parameter representing the frequency of interaction between individuals. We find that the predicted infections agree reasonably well with the reported cases. We clearly see the effect of ""shelter-in-place"" policies introduced at the onset of the pandemic. Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel. We find that this policy is successful in decreasing the epidemic size and slowing down the spread, but less effective than the shelter-in-place policy. This policy can result in a pulled wave of infections. We express its velocity and characterize the shape of the traveling front as a function of the epidemiological parameters.

To resolve causal variants, meta-analysis studies typically apply summary statistics-based fine-mapping methods as they are applied to single-cohort studies. However, it is unclear whether heterogeneous characteristics of each cohort (e.g., ancestry, sample size, phenotyping, genotyping, or imputation) affect fine-mapping calibration and recall. Here, we first demonstrate that meta-analysis fine-mapping is substantially miscalibrated in simulations when different genotyping arrays or imputation panels are included. To mitigate these issues, we propose a summary statistics-based QC method, SLALOM, that identifies suspicious loci for meta-analysis fine-mapping by detecting outliers in association statistics based on ancestry-matched local LD structure. Having validated SLALOM performance in simulations and the GWAS Catalog, we applied it to 14 disease endpoints from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative and found that 67% of loci showed suspicious patterns that call into question fine-mapping accuracy. These predicted suspicious loci were significantly depleted for having likely causal variants, such as nonsynonymous variants, as a lead variant (2.7x; Fishers exact P = 7.3 x 10-4). Compared to fine-mapping results in individual biobanks, we found limited evidence of fine-mapping improvement in the GBMI meta-analyses.

To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, whereas others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each individual mutant in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, whereas others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with the same resistance gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with different resistance genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others. We add to a growing body of work describing the key role of phages in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host communities. Beyond this specific trait, our study provides a new insight into the genetic architecture of historical contingency, a crucial component of interpreting and predicting evolution.",bacteriophages; epistasis; experimental evolution; historical contingency; microbial evolution; parallel evolution,,,,,2022-08-23 00:00:00,,2022/8/23,Reena Debray; Nina De Luna; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Reena Debray: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.Nina De Luna: Department of Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,10.1101/2022.02.10.479996,,,0

Studies of hepatoblastoma that focus exclusively on tumor cells demonstrate sparse somatic mutations and a common cell of origin, the hepatoblast, across patients. In contrast to the homogeneity these studies would suggest, hepatoblastoma tumors have a high degree of heterogeneity that can portend poor prognosis. In this study, we use single-cell transcriptomic techniques to analyze resected human pediatric hepatoblastoma specimens, and identify five hepatoblastoma tumor signatures that may account for the tumor heterogeneity observed in this disease. Notably, patient-derived hepatoblastoma spheroid cultures predict differential responses to treatment based on the transcriptomic signature of each tumor, suggesting a path forward for precision oncology for these tumors.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue composition within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude. These results suggest that our EIS smart bone plate can provide continuous and highly sensitive quantitative tissue measurements throughout the course of fracture healing to better guide personalized clinical care.",Bluetooth transmission; bone fracture repair; electrical impedance spectroscopy; longitudinal monitoring; smart bone plate; wireless measurements,,,,,2022-08-27 00:00:00,2022/08/19,2022/8/27,Naomasa Fukase; Victoria R Duke; Monica C Lin; Ingrid K Stake; Matthieu Huard; Johnny Huard; Meir T Marmor; Michel M Maharbiz; Nicole P Ehrhart; Chelsea S Bahney; Safa T Herfat,,"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Clinical Sciences, Flint Animal Cancer Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ostfold Hospital Trust, 1714 Graalum, Norway.; Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Naomasa Fukase: Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.Victoria R Duke: Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.Monica C Lin: UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Ingrid K Stake: Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ostfold Hospital Trust, 1714 Graalum, Norway.Matthieu Huard: Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.Johnny Huard: Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.Meir T Marmor: UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.Michel M Maharbiz: Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.Nicole P Ehrhart: Department of Clinical Sciences, Flint Animal Cancer Center, College of Veterinary Medicine, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.Chelsea S Bahney: Linda and Mitch Hart Center for Regenerative & Personalized Medicine at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, CO 81657, USA.; UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.Safa T Herfat: UCSF Orthopaedic Trauma Institute, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.23.501237,4,0

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces an intrinsically different data type than scRNA-seq and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas as well as from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results. We conclude that compared to scRNA-seq, MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for measuring single-cell gene expression and can robustly identify cell types without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq reference atlases.",,,biorxiv;2022.03.04.483068,3.0,new results,2022-09-01 00:00:00,09/01/2022,,Jonathan Liu; Vanessa Tran; Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri; Ashley Byrne; Michael Borja; Yang Joon Kim; Snigdha Agarwal; Ruofan Wang; Kyle Awayan; Abhishek Murti; Aris Taychameekiatchai; Bruce Wang; George Emanuel; Jiang He; John Haliburton; Angela Oliveira Pisco; Norma Neff,"Liu, J.; Tran, V.; Vemuri, V.

PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.",disease models; genetics; genome engineering; genomics; hPSCs; human; parkinson's disease; prime editing; regenerative medicine; stem cells,,,,,2022-09-08 00:00:00,2022/09/07,2022/9/8,Hanqin Li; Oriol Busquets; Yogendra Verma; Khaja Mohieddin Syed; Nitzan Kutnowski; Gabriella R Pangilinan; Luke A Gilbert; Helen S Bateup; Donald C Rio; Dirk Hockemeyer; Frank Soldner,,"Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network, Chevy Chase, United States.; Dominick P.

When HARs were discovered in 2006, their function was mysterious due to scant annotation of the noncoding genome. Diverse technologies, from transgenic animals to machine learning, have consistently shown that HARs function as gene regulatory enhancers with significant enrichment in neurodevelopment. It is now possible to quantitatively measure the enhancer activity of thousands of HARs in parallel and model how each nucleotide contributes to gene expression. These strategies have revealed that many human HAR sequences function differently than their chimpanzee orthologs, though individual nucleotide changes in the same HAR may have opposite effects, consistent with compensatory substitutions.

However, the model communities studied to date have been defined or complex, but not both, limiting their utility. Here, we construct and characterize in vitro a defined community of 104 bacterial species composed of the most common taxa from the human gut microbiota (hCom1). We then used an iterative experimental process to fill open niches: germ-free mice were colonized with hCom1 and then challenged with a human fecal sample. We identified new species that engrafted following fecal challenge and added them to hCom1, yielding hCom2. In gnotobiotic mice, hCom2 exhibited increased stability to fecal challenge and robust colonization resistance against pathogenic Escherichia coli. Mice colonized by either hCom2 or a human fecal community are phenotypically similar, suggesting that this consortium will enable a mechanistic interrogation of species and genes on microbiome-associated phenotypes.",,,,,,2022-09-08 00:00:00,2022/09/06,2022/9/8,Alice G Cheng; Po-Yi Ho; Andrés Aranda-Díaz; Sunit Jain; Feiqiao B Yu; Xiandong Meng; Min Wang; Mikhail Iakiviak; Kazuki Nagashima; Aishan Zhao; Pallavi Murugkar; Advait Patil; Katayoon Atabakhsh; Allison Weakley; Jia Yan; Ariel R Brumbaugh; Steven Higginbottom; Alejandra Dimas; Anthony L Shiver; Adam Deutschbauer; Norma Neff; Justin L Sonnenburg; Kerwyn Casey Huang; Michael A Fischbach,,"ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Here, we created a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain NCIB 3610 and investigated growth, biofilm colony wrinkling, and sporulation phenotypes of the knockdown library. First, we showed that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. Second, we quantified biofilm colony wrinkling using a custom image analysis algorithm and found that fatty acid synthesis and DNA gyrase knockdown strains exhibited increased wrinkling independent of biofilm matrix gene expression. Third, we designed a high-throughput screen to quantify sporulation efficiency after essential gene knockdown; we found that partial knockdowns of essential genes remained competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but knockdown of essential genes involved in fatty acid synthesis exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. We conclude that a subset of essential genes are particularly important for biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes.

SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments.

By specifically counting colocalized signals, we can eliminate the effects of background produced by non-specific binding of detection antibodies. Using TNF-α, we show that SiMCA achieves a three-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays and exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such as serum and blood.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,,,,,2022-09-16 00:00:00,2022/09/15,2022/9/16,Brent Townshend; Matias Kaplan; Christina D Smolke,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.","Brent Townshend: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Matias Kaplan: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Christina D Smolke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.",,,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,9,0

Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs.

This pattern, consistent with compensatory evolution, was confirmed using massively parallel reporter assays in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells. The species-specific enhancer activity of assayed HARs was accurately predicted from the presence and absence of transcription factor footprints in each species. Despite these striking cis effects, activity of a given HAR sequence was nearly identical in human and chimpanzee cells. These findings suggest that HARs did not evolve to compensate for changes in the trans environment but instead altered their ability to bind factors present in both species.

The dysregulation of ceramide metabolism has been implicated in cancer evasion of apoptosis and targeting ceramide metabolism has potential therapeutic benefits as a strategy to kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to ceramide-mediated cell death are vastly intertwined and incompletely understood. To shed light on this mystery, we performed a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify regulators of cancer resistance to the soluble short chain ceramide, C6 ceramide (C6-Cer). Our results reveal a complex landscape of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity, including genes associated with ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and membrane biology. Furthermore, we find that loss of the phospholipid flippase subunit TMEM30A impairs the plasma membrane trafficking of its binding partner the P4-type ATPase ATP11B, and depletion of TMEM30A or ATP11B disrupts plasma membrane asymmetry and promotes resistance to C6-Cer toxicity independent of alterations in C6-Cer uptake.

However, existing methods for conducting TWAS do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We introduce CONTENT-a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We apply CONTENT to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell RNA-seq data sets and show that CONTENT leads to a 42% (bulk) and 110% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. We find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75% in single-cell data, consistent with cell-type heterogeneity in bulk tissue.

To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from 'sizers', in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to 'adders', in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks. If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells in vivo, sizers become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for the fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i>. For some size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division cycle of the green algae <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.

From whole-blood gene expression data, we distinguished patients with sepsis from patients with non-infectious systemic inflammatory conditions using a trained bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 in the training set; AUC = 0.82 in a held-out validation set). Plasma RNA also yielded a transcriptional signature of sepsis with several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers, and a bSVM sepsis diagnostic classifier (AUC = 0.97 training set; AUC = 0.77 validation set). Pathogen detection performance of plasma mNGS varied on the basis of pathogen and site of infection. To improve detection of virus, we developed a secondary transcriptomic classifier (AUC = 0.94 training set; AUC = 0.96 validation set). We combined host and microbial features to develop an integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 99% of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 74% of suspected and 89% of indeterminate sepsis cases.

Here, we present structure-function analyses of a lipid-, substrate-, and NADH-bound complex comprising two complex Q subunits: the hydroxylase COQ7 and the lipid-binding protein COQ9. We reveal that COQ7 adopts a ferritin-like fold with a hydrophobic channel whose substrate-binding capacity is enhanced by COQ9. Using molecular dynamics, we further show that two COQ7:COQ9 heterodimers form a curved tetramer that deforms the membrane, potentially opening a pathway for the CoQ intermediates to translocate from the bilayer to the proteins' lipid-binding sites. Two such tetramers assemble into a soluble octamer with a pseudo-bilayer of lipids captured within.

In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al., 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.",cell biology; chromosome segregation; coarse-grained modeling; mechanics; microtubules; p. tridactylis; physics of living systems; spindle,,,,,2022-11-09 00:00:00,2022/11/08,2022/11/9,Pooja Suresh; Vahe Galstyan; Rob Phillips; Sophie Dumont,,"Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics Option, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States.; A.

The dysregulation of ceramide metabolism has been implicated in cancer evasion of apoptosis and targeting ceramide metabolism has potential therapeutic benefits as a strategy to kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to ceramide-mediated cell death are vastly intertwined and incompletely understood. To shed light on this mystery, we performed a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify regulators of cancer resistance to the soluble short chain ceramide, C6 ceramide (C6-Cer). Our results reveal a complex landscape of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity, including genes associated with ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and membrane biology. Furthermore, we find that loss of the phospholipid flippase subunit TMEM30A impairs the plasma membrane trafficking of its binding partner, the P4-type ATPase ATP11B, and depletion of TMEM30A or ATP11B disrupts plasma membrane asymmetry and promotes resistance to C6-Cer toxicity.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS. These results open up new avenues for improving picoscale droplet RT-PCR reactions and expanding microfluidic droplet-based single-cell analysis technologies.",,,,,,01/05/2023,2023/01/04,2023/1/5,Margarita Khariton; Conor J McClune; Kara K Brower; Sandy Klemm; Elizabeth S Sattely; Polly M Fordyce; Bo Wang,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94110, United States.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.","Margarita Khariton: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Conor J McClune: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kara K Brower: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Sandy Klemm: Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Elizabeth S Sattely: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Polly M Fordyce: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94110, United States.Bo Wang: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.08.16.504154,20,1

Despite a deluge oftightly-focused and necessarily technical studies exploring each facet of""human impacts"" on the planet, their integration into a complete picture of thehuman-Earth system lags far behind. Here, we quantify twelve dimensionlessratios which put the magnitude of human impacts in context, comparing themagnitude of anthropogenic processes to their natural analogues. These ratioscapture the extent to which humans alter the terrestrial surface, hydrosphere,biosphere, atmosphere, and biogeochemistry of Earth. In almost all twelvecases, the impact of human processes rivals or exceeds their naturalcounterparts. The values and corresponding uncertainties for these impacts atglobal and regional resolution are drawn from the primary scientificliterature, governmental and international databases, and industry reports. Wepresent this synthesis of the current ""state of affairs"" as a graphicalsnapshot designed to be used as a reference. Furthermore, we establish asearchable database termed the Human Impacts Database (www.anthroponumbers.org)which houses all quantities reported here and many others with extensivecuration and annotation.

Inmammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to andsegregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to thedynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation tomechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinctresponse features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh etal. 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces arenecessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remainunclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine withmanipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. Bysystematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solelyat k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes,but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 $\mu$m lengthscale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preservesk-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles.Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting nearchromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting atpoles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives riseto spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose arekey for function.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04461,arXiv:2204.04461v1,,,04/09/2022,04/09/2022,,Pooja Suresh; Vahe Galstyan; Rob Phillips; Sophie Dumont,,,,,,,Now published in eLife 10.7554/eLife.79558,16,1

Using the antibody sequences of B cells, we tracked clones during in vitro differentiation. Clonal analysis revealed a subset of IgM+ B cells which were more proliferative than other B-cell types. Whereas the population of B cells adopted diverse states during differentiation, clones had a restricted set of fates available to them; there were two times more single-fate clones than expected given population-level cell-type diversity. This implicated a molecular memory of initial cell states that was propagated through differentiation. We then identified the genes which had strongest coherence within clones. These genes significantly overlapped known B-cell fate determination programs, suggesting the genes which determine cell identity are most robustly controlled on a clonal level. Persistent clonal identities were also observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, indicating that these transcriptional programs maintain long-term cell identities in vivo.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation across archaeal ribosomes in the peptidyl transferase center that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,,,,01/21/2023,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Amos J Nissley; Petar I Penev; Zoe L Watson; Jillian F Banfield; Jamie H D Cate,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Amos J Nissley: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Petar I Penev: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Zoe L Watson: California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jamie H D Cate: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,23,1
