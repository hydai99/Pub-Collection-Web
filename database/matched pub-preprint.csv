Olzmann",biorxiv,Ribosome stalling during selenoprotein translation exposes a ferroptosis vulnerability in cancer,"Ferroptosis is a regulated, iron-dependent form of necrosis that is triggered by the accumulation of oxidatively damaged phospholipids1–3. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents ferroptosis by converting phospholipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols4, 5. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathology of several degenerative conditions and inhibiting GPX4 activity has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to induce cancer cell death1, 2. However, many cancer cell lines are resistant to GPX4 inhibition6, and the mechanisms that regulate GPX4 activity and ferroptosis resistance remain incompletely understood. Here, employing a synthetic lethal CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor. LRP8 is upregulated in cancer, and we find that it promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells in both 2-dimensional (2-D) cell culture and 3-dimensional (3-D) spheroid models. Mechanistically, loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels, resulting in the reduced expression of a subset of selenoproteins, including GPX4. Remarkably, the reduction in GPX4 is not due to the classic hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program7, 8. Instead, our findings demonstrate that the translation of GPX4 is severely impaired in the selenium-deficient LRP8 knockout (KO) cells due to extensive ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine (SEC) UGA codon, which results in ribosome collisions and early translation termination. Thus, our findings reveal ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as targetable ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer cells.",,10.1101/2022.04.11.487892,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.11.487892v1,2022.04.11.487892,4/11/2022,,4/11/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,Now published in Nat Chem Biol 10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,1

Using a chronic antigen stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to systematically discover genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of several epigenetic regulators, including members of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo paired CRISPR perturbation and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of terminal exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a-depletion limited the global acquisition of chromatin accessibility associated with T cell exhaustion and led to improved anti-tumor immunity after adoptive cell therapy.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.Authors’ Summary Mechanisms underlying nonlytic release of canonical nonenveloped viruses from infected cells are poorly understood. We show here that release of hepatitis A virus from cells in exosome-like vesicles requires nonredundant activities of two distinct Bro1-domain proteins associated with host cell machinery (ESCRT) for endosomal sorting, HD-PTP and ALIX. We demonstrate both Bro1 domain proteins are recruited to the viral capsid by the pX segment of the 1D capsid protein, and that they act in a non-redundant manner to mediate virus release. Fusing pX to a self-assembling nanocage protein resulted in ESCRT-dependent release mediated by a short pX peptide sequence conserved in hepatoviruses from bats to humans. Mutations within the pX sequence ablate release and result in noncytolytic virus accumulating intracellularly. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows nonlytic release of quasi-enveloped virus is an ancient evolutionary trait of hepatoviruses.",,10.1101/2022.04.26.489493,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.26.489493v1,2022.04.26.489493,4/26/2022,,4/26/2022,"Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Cell Biology & Physiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Diamond Light Source; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Diamond Light Source; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Cell Biology & Physiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Diamond Light Source; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill",,,0.0,Now published in PLoS Pathog 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010543.,4
