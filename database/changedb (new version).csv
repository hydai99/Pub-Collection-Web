Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering. The application of CRISPR technology to edit the non-coding genome, modulate gene regulation, make precise genetic changes and target infectious diseases has the potential to lead to curative therapies for many previously untreatable diseases.",,,,,,10/26/2022,2022/10/24,2022/10/26,Michael Chavez; Xinyi Chen; Paul B Finn; Lei S Qi,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.","Michael Chavez: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Xinyi Chen: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Paul B Finn: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Lei S Qi: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.",,,,,,1
