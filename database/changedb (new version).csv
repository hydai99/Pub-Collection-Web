Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity.

This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering. The application of CRISPR technology to edit the non-coding genome, modulate gene regulation, make precise genetic changes and target infectious diseases has the potential to lead to curative therapies for many previously untreatable diseases.",,,,,,10/26/2022,2022/10/24,2022/10/26,Michael Chavez; Xinyi Chen; Paul B Finn; Lei S Qi,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.","Michael Chavez: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Xinyi Chen: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Paul B Finn: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Lei S Qi: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.",,,,,,1

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single-cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both the liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization. Our work highlights the power and necessity of type-specific neuronal access and time-lapse imaging in identifying wiring mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of functional neural maps.",,,biorxiv;2022.12.28.522173,1,new results,12/29/2022,12/29/2022,,Kenneth Kin Lam Wong; Tongchao Li; Tian-Ming Fu; Gaoxiang Liu; Cheng Lyu; Sayeh Kohani; Qijing Xie; David J Luginbuhl; Srigokul Upadhyayula; Eric Betzig; Liqun Luo,"Wong, K.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

We find that while mammals resemble one another in total TE content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly LINEs, drive increases in genome size while DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to accumulate only a few types of TE at any given time, with one TE type dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental mammals.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

Almost three decades ago, Tonerand Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, orherds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of theToner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve thegoverning equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developedformalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scatteringobstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results toanalytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature,moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on avariety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients anddynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatileincorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps ofparameter space.

Thekey insight to our approach is to plan an action sequence that maximizes theexpected information gain about the optimal trajectory for the task at hand. Wedemonstrate that our method learns strong policies with 2x fewer samples thanstrong exploration baselines and 200x fewer samples than model free methods ona diverse set of low-to-medium dimensional control tasks in both the open-loopand closed-loop control settings.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04642,arXiv:2210.04642v1,,,10/06/2022,10/06/2022,,Viraj Mehta; Ian Char; Joseph Abbate; Rory Conlin; Mark D.

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action tothe AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promisingdirections for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI.

Neural networkscan assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manualannotations, while unsupervised approaches have fared poorly in ultrasound todate. Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labelsrequired) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinicaldomain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements. We also tested our pipeline againstexternal images from an additional 10,030 patients (20,060 images) withavailable manual tracings of the left ventricle. Results: r2 between clinicallymeasured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reportedinter-clinician variation for LVESV and LVEDV (pipeline vs. clinical r2= 0.74and r2=0.65, respectively), LVEF and LV mass (r2= 0.46 and r2=0.54), left andright atrium volumes (r2=0.7 and r2=0.6), and right ventricle area (r2=0.47).When binarized into normal vs. abnormal categories, average accuracy was 0.81(range 0.71-0.95).

Given a predefined neighborhood structure, the Concretescore of any input is defined by the rate of change of the probabilities withrespect to local directional changes of the input. This formulation allows usto recover the (Stein) score in continuous domains when measuring such changesby the Euclidean distance, while using the Manhattan distance leads to ournovel score function in discrete domains. Finally, we introduce a new frameworkto learn such scores from samples called Concrete Score Matching (CSM), andpropose an efficient training objective to scale our approach to highdimensions.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested.
