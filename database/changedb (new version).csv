A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs. This study introduces a new robust tool for studying mammalian transcriptional regulation and demonstrates the power of optogenetic tools in dissecting the quantitative features of important cellular pathways.",,10.1101/2022.08.03.502739,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.03.502739v1,2022.08.03.502739,8/5/2022,,8/5/2022,"Altos Labs; BigHat Biosciences; Cell Design Initiative, UCSF; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA; Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Development and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; BigHat Biosciences; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Development and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Altos Labs; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Cell Design Initiative, UCSF; Altos Labs",,,1,,

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers. These intermediate EMP markers correlated with worse patient outcomes and could serve as potential new therapeutic targets to block metastatic development.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502697,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502697v1,2022.08.04.502697,8/5/2022,,8/5/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Genentech Inc.; Institute of Internal Medicine D, Medical Cell Biology, University Hospital Münster","Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Institute of Internal Medicine D, Medical Cell Biology, University Hospital Münster; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Genentech Inc.; Department of Anatomy, University of California",,,1,,

Although much has been learned about their physiology and their Madagascar ecology and phylogeny, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell type evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell profiles to those of the homologous cells in human and mouse. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate cell specialization even within a single tissue compartment, as well as many cell types for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse.

Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy.

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.Methods The gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.Results Variation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.Conclusions The observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502150,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502150v1,2022.07.30.502150,08/02/2022,,08/02/2022,"Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine","Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection.

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.

Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat. This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.",,10.1101/2021.10.16.464650,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.16.464650v2,2021.10.16.464650,08/03/2022,,08/03/2022,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine","Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford Center for Genomics & Personalized Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

To address this gap, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from 140 HL germline and 146 matched breast tumors and RNA-seq for the tumors. We generated somatic-mutation profiles, identified copy-number alterations (CNAs), and compared results to non-Hispanic White (White) women in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Similar to Whites, PIK3CA and TP53 were the most commonly mutated genes in breast tumors from H/L. We found 4 common COSMIC mutation signatures (1, 2, 3, 13) and signature 16 not previously reported in other breast-cancer datasets. We observed recurrent amplifications in breast-cancer drivers including MYC, FGFR1, CCND1, and ERBB2, and a recurrent amplification on 17q11.2 associated with high KIAA0100 gene expression, implicated in breast-cancer aggressiveness.

We present a complete thermodynamic model for RNA binding to the S. cerevisiae Pumilio protein PUF4 derived from direct binding data for 6180 RNAs measured using the RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) platform. The PUF4 model is highly similar to that of the related RBPs, human PUM2 and PUM1, with one marked exception: a single favorable site of base flipping for PUF4, such that PUF4 preferentially binds to a non-contiguous series of residues.

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers.

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs.

Lishko",biorxiv,Mitochondrial uncouplers impair human sperm motility without altering ATP content,"Sperm motility is necessary for successful fertilization, but there remains controversy about whether human sperm motility is primarily powered by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.Significance Statement Development of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502752,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502752v2,2022.08.04.502752,08/08/2022,,08/08/2022,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Urology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University","Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Urology, University of California; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging",,,1.0,,

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Despite its ubiquity, the complexity of designing and controlling custom microfluidic devices present major barriers to adoption, requiring intuitive knowledge gained from years of experience. If these barriers were overcome, microfluidics could miniaturize biological and chemical research for non-experts through fully-automated platform development and operation. The intuition of microfluidic experts can be captured through machine learning, where complex statistical models are trained for pattern recognition and subsequently used for event prediction. Integration of machine learning with microfluidics could significantly expand its adoption and impact.

Attempts have been made in the past to computationally predict which bacterial species and enzymes are responsible for chemical transformations in the gut environment, but with low accuracy due to minimal chemical representation and sequence similarity search schemes. Here, we present an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER). We show that SIMMER predicts the chemistry and responsible species and enzymes for a queried reaction with high accuracy, unlike previous methods. We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug transformations known to occur in the human gut. Bacterial species containing these enzymes are enriched within human donor stool samples that metabolize the query compound. After demonstrating its utility and accuracy, we chose to make SIMMER available as both a command-line and web tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical transformations within the human gut. We present SIMMER as a computational addition to the microbiome researcher's toolbox, enabling them to make informed hypotheses before embarking on the lengthy laboratory experiments required to characterize novel bacterial enzymes that can alter human ingested compounds.",,10.1101/2022.08.02.502504,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.02.502504v2,2022.08.02.502504,08/11/2022,,08/11/2022,"Gladstone Institutes; University of California, San Francisco; University of California, San Francisco / Gladstone Institutes","University of California, San Francisco / Gladstone Institutes; Gladstone Institutes; University of California, San Francisco",,,1.0,,

A lack of suitable model systems limits the mechanistic understanding of telomere shortening in the stem cells and thus hinders the development of treatment options for BM failure. Here, we endogenously introduced TIN2-DC mutations in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to dissect the disease mechanism and identify a gene-editing strategy that rescued the disease phenotypes. The hESCs with the T284R disease mutation exhibited the short telomere phenotype observed in DC patients. Yet, telomeres in mutant hESCs did not trigger DNA damage responses at telomeres or show exacerbated telomere shortening when differentiated into telomerase-negative cells. Disruption of the mutant TINF2 allele by introducing a frameshift mutation in exon 2 restored telomere length in stem cells and the replicative potential of differentiated cells. Similarly, we introduced TIN2-DC disease variants in human HSPCs to assess the changes in telomere length and proliferative capacity. Lastly, we showed that editing at exon 2 of TINF2 that restored telomere length in hESCs could be generated in TINF2-DC patient HSPCs. Our study demonstrates a simple genetic intervention that rescues the TIN2-DC disease phenotype in stem cells and provides a versatile platform to assess the efficacy of potential therapeutic approaches in vivo.",35421215,10.1182/blood.2021013750.,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2021013750,,,08/11/2022,08/11/2022,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.2 Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.3 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; and.5 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.",,,2022 Aug 11;140(6):608-618.,1.0,,
