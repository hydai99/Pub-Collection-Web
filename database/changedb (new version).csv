A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs. This study introduces a new robust tool for studying mammalian transcriptional regulation and demonstrates the power of optogenetic tools in dissecting the quantitative features of important cellular pathways.",,10.1101/2022.08.03.502739,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.03.502739v1,2022.08.03.502739,08/05/2022,,2022-08-05,"Altos Labs; BigHat Biosciences; Cell Design Initiative, UCSF; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA; Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Development and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; BigHat Biosciences; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Robin Chemers Neustein Laboratory of Mammalian Development and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Altos Labs; Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences, UCLA; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UCLA; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UCSF; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Cell Design Initiative, UCSF; Altos Labs",,,1.0,,

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers. These intermediate EMP markers correlated with worse patient outcomes and could serve as potential new therapeutic targets to block metastatic development.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502697,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502697v1,2022.08.04.502697,08/05/2022,,2022-08-05,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Genentech Inc.; Institute of Internal Medicine D, Medical Cell Biology, University Hospital Münster","Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Institute of Internal Medicine D, Medical Cell Biology, University Hospital Münster; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Genentech Inc.; Department of Anatomy, University of California",,,1.0,,

Although much has been learned about their physiology and their Madagascar ecology and phylogeny, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell type evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell profiles to those of the homologous cells in human and mouse. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate cell specialization even within a single tissue compartment, as well as many cell types for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse. The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this primate model organism, and establishes a general approach for other emerging model organisms.",,10.1101/2021.12.12.469460,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.469460v2,2021.12.12.469460,08/07/2022,,2022-08-07,"Academy of Statistics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, KLATASDS-MOE, East China Normal University; Adaptive Mechanisms and Evolution (MECADEV), UMR 7179, National Center for Scientific Research, National Museum of Natural History; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and Center for Aging Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Comparative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Mathematics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Nancy E. and Peter C.

Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy. In combination with signaling and simulation data, this study provides mechanistic insights into CB1 activation by different classes of ligands, and sheds light on the G protein preferences between endogenous and exogenous ligands.",,10.1101/2022.08.06.502185,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.06.502185v1,2022.08.06.502185,08/07/2022,,2022-08-07,"Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Photon Science, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University; Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University","Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University; Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University; Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University; Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University; Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University; Center for Drug Discovery, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Photon Science, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,1.0,,
