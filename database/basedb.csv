Cassava, Manihot esculenta Crantz, is a crop of societal and agricultural importance in tropical regions around the world. Genomics provides a platform for accelerated improvement of cassava's nutritional and agronomic traits, as well as for illuminating aspects of cassava's history including its path towards domestication. The highly heterozygous nature of the cassava genome is widely recognized. However, the full extent and context of this heterozygosity has been difficult to reveal because of technological limitations within genome sequencing. Only recently, with several new long-read sequencing technologies coming online, has the genomics community been able to tackle some similarly difficult genomes. In light of these recent advances, we provide this review to document the current status of the cassava genome and genomic resources and provide a perspective on what to look forward to in the coming years.",Cassava; Crop improvement; Genomics; Heterozygous genomes; Phased genomes,,,,,2021-02-20 00:00:00,2021/02/18,2021/2/20,Jessica B Lyons; Jessen V Bredeson; Ben N Mansfeld; Guillaume Jean Bauchet; Jeffrey Berry; Adam Boyher; Lukas A Mueller; Daniel S Rokhsar; Rebecca S Bart,,"Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.; Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; DOE Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, 499 Illinois, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.; Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), St. Louis, MO, 63132, USA.; Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), St. Louis, MO, 63132, USA. rbart@danforthcenter.org.","Jessica B Lyons: Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.Jessen V Bredeson: Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.Ben N Mansfeld: Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), St. Louis, MO, 63132, USA.Guillaume Jean Bauchet: Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.Jeffrey Berry: Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), St. Louis, MO, 63132, USA.Adam Boyher: Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), St. Louis, MO, 63132, USA.Lukas A Mueller: Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.Daniel S Rokhsar: Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.; DOE Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, 499 Illinois, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.Rebecca S Bart: Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC), St. Louis, MO, 63132, USA. rbart@danforthcenter.org.",,,,,,0

We measured the impact of 200 TP53 and KRAS variants on RNA profiles in over 300,000 single lung cancer cells, and used the profiles to categorize variants into phenotypic subsets to distinguish gain-of-function, loss-of-function and dominant negative variants, which we validated by comparison with orthogonal assays. We discovered that KRAS variants did not merely fit into discrete functional categories, but spanned a continuum of gain-of-function phenotypes, and that their functional impact could not have been predicted solely by their frequency in patient cohorts.

In response to infection by its viral host ICP1, PLE excises, replicates and hijacks ICP1 structural components for transduction. Through an unknown mechanism, PLE prevents ICP1 from transitioning to rolling circle replication (RCR), a prerequisite for efficient packaging of the viral genome. Here, we characterize a PLE-encoded nuclease, NixI, that blocks phage development likely by nicking ICP1's genome as it transitions to RCR. NixI-dependent cleavage sites appear in ICP1's genome during infection of PLE(+) V. cholerae. Purified NixI demonstrates in vitro nuclease activity specifically for sites in ICP1's genome and we identify a motif that is necessary for NixI-mediated cleavage. Importantly, NixI is sufficient to limit ICP1 genome replication and eliminate progeny production, representing the most inhibitory PLE-encoded mechanism revealed to date. We identify distant NixI homologs in an expanded family of putative phage parasites in vibrios that lack nucleotide homology to PLEs but nonetheless share genomic synteny with PLEs.

To address these limitations, we developed directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq), which uses antibody-tethered enzymes to methylate DNA near a target protein's binding sites in situ. These exogenous methylation marks are then detected simultaneously with endogenous CpG methylation on unamplified DNA using long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies.

A lack of suitable model systems limits the mechanistic understanding of telomere shortening in the stem cells and thus hinders the development of treatment options for BM failure. Here, we endogenously introduced TIN2-DC mutations in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to dissect the disease mechanism and identify a gene-editing strategy that rescued the disease phenotypes. The hESCs with the T284R disease mutation exhibited the short telomere phenotype observed in DC patients. Yet, telomeres in mutant hESCs did not trigger DNA damage responses at telomeres or show exacerbated telomere shortening when differentiated into telomerase-negative cells. Disruption of the mutant TINF2 allele by introducing a frameshift mutation in exon 2 restored telomere length in stem cells and the replicative potential of differentiated cells. Similarly, we introduced TIN2-DC disease variants in human HSPCs to assess the changes in telomere length and proliferative capacity. Lastly, we showed that editing at exon 2 of TINF2 that restored telomere length in hESCs could be generated in TINF2-DC patient HSPCs.

We reported that AAK1 and GAK control intracellular trafficking of RNA viruses and revealed a requirement for BIKE in early and late stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, the downstream targets phosphorylated by BIKE have not yet been identified. Here, to identify BIKE substrates, we conducted a barcode fusion genetics-yeast two-hybrid screen and retrieved publicly available data generated via affinity-purification mass spectrometry. We subsequently validated 19 of 47 putative BIKE interactors using mammalian cell-based protein-protein interaction assays. We found that CLINT1, a cargo-specific adapter implicated in bidirectional Golgi-to-endosome trafficking, emerged as a predominant hit in both screens. Our experiments indicated that BIKE catalyzes phosphorylation of a threonine 294 CLINT1 residue both in vitro and in cell culture. Our findings revealed that CLINT1 phosphorylation mediates its binding to the DENV nonstructural 3 protein and subsequently promotes DENV assembly and egress. Additionally, using live-cell imaging we revealed that CLINT1 cotraffics with DENV particles and is involved in mediating BIKE's role in DENV infection. Finally, our data suggest that additional cellular BIKE interactors implicated in the host immune and stress responses and the ubiquitin proteasome system might also be candidate phosphorylation substrates of BIKE. In conclusion, these findings reveal cellular substrates and pathways regulated by the understudied Numb-associated kinase enzyme BIKE, a mechanism for CLINT1 regulation, and control of DENV infection via BIKE signaling, with potential implications for cell biology, virology, and host-targeted antiviral design.",BIKE; CLINT1; NAK kinase; cell signaling; dengue virus (DENV); host–pathogen interaction; intracellular trafficking; proteomics; virus assembly,,,,,2022-04-23 00:00:00,2022/04/20,2022/4/23,Stanford Schor; Szuyuan Pu; Vlad Nicolaescu; Siavash Azari; Mardo Kõivomägi; Marwah Karim; Patricia Cassonnet; Sirle Saul; Gregory Neveu; Andrew Yueh; Caroline Demeret; Jan M Skotheim; Yves Jacob; Glenn Randall; Shirit Einav,,"Department of Biology, Stanford University, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, California, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.

Here, we discuss emerging technologies for defining motor neuron heterogeneity in the adult motor system as well as implications for disease and spinal cord injury. We establish a roadmap for future applications of emerging techniques - such as epigenetic profiling, spatial RNA sequencing, and single-cell somatic mutational profiling to adult motor neurons, which will revolutionize our understanding of the healthy and degenerating adult motor system.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; motor neuron disease; motor neurons; single-cell sequencing; spatial transcriptomics; spinal cord,,,,,2022-04-30 00:00:00,2022/04/26,2022/4/30,Jacob A Blum; Aaron D Gitler,,"Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

However, the estimated velocity only gives a snapshot of how the transcriptome instantaneously changes in individual cells, and it does not provide quantitative predictions and insights about the whole system. In this work, we develop RNA-ODE, a principled computational framework that extends RNA velocity to quantify systems level dynamics and improve single-cell data analysis. We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism. Given a snapshot of gene expression at one time, RNA-ODE is able to predict and extrapolate the expression trajectory of each cell by solving the dynamic equations. Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also infers gene regulatory networks and identifies influential genes whose expression changes can decide cell fate. We expect RNA-ODE to be a Swiss army knife that aids many facets of single-cell RNA-seq analysis.",RNA velocity; dynamical systems model of biology; expression dynamics; machine learning; single-cell RNA sequencing,,,,,2022-05-01 00:00:00,2022/04/27,2022/5/1,Ruishan Liu; Angela Oliveira Pisco; Emelie Braun; Sten Linnarsson; James Zou,,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

However, our understanding of LCMV and its interactions with human host factors remains incomplete. Here, host determinants affecting LCMV infection were investigated through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in A549 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma line. We identified and validated a variety of novel host factors that play a functional role in LCMV infection. Among these, knockout of the sialomucin CD164, a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein, was found to ablate infection with multiple LCMV strains but not other hemorrhagic mammarenaviruses in several cell types. Further characterization revealed a dependency of LCMV entry on the cysteine-rich domain of CD164, including an N-linked glycosylation site at residue 104 in that region. Given the documented role of LCMV with respect to transplacental human infections, CD164 expression was investigated in human placental tissue and placental cell lines. CD164 was found to be highly expressed in the cytotrophoblast cells, an initial contact site for pathogens within the placenta, and LCMV infection in placental cells was effectively blocked using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cysteine-rich domain of CD164. Together, this study identifies novel factors associated with LCMV infection of human tissues and highlights the importance of CD164, a sialomucin that previously had not been associated with viral infection.

While we know nearly all mammalian kinetochore proteins, how these give rise to the strong yet dynamic microtubule attachments required for function remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the Astrin-SKAP complex, which localizes to bioriented kinetochores and is essential for chromosome segregation but whose mechanical role is unclear. Live imaging reveals that SKAP depletion dampens the movement and decreases the coordination of metaphase sister kinetochores and increases the tension between them. Using laser ablation to isolate kinetochores bound to polymerizing versus depolymerizing microtubules, we show that without SKAP, kinetochores move slower on both polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules and that more force is needed to rescue microtubules to polymerize. Thus, in contrast to the previously described kinetochore proteins that increase the grip on microtubules under force, Astrin-SKAP reduces the grip, increasing attachment dynamics and force responsiveness and reducing friction. Together, our findings suggest a model where the Astrin-SKAP complex effectively ""lubricates"" correct, bioriented attachments to help preserve them.",Astrin-SKAP; dynamics; force; friction; grip; kinetochore; mammal; mechanics; microtubule; spindle,,,,,2022-05-18 00:00:00,2022/05/16,2022/5/18,Miquel Rosas-Salvans; Renaldo Sutanto; Pooja Suresh; Sophie Dumont,,"Department of Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences, UCSF, 600 16th Street, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences, UCSF, 600 16th Street, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency. This study sheds light on the role of co-occurring genetic alterations and on the effect of splicing factor deficiency on the modulation of sensitivity to targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapy.",Cancer gene therapy;

Here, we introduce Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP), which combines artificial-intelligence-driven image analysis of cellular phenotypes with automated single-cell or single-nucleus laser microdissection and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. DVP links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context. By individually excising nuclei from cell culture, we classified distinct cell states with proteomic profiles defined by known and uncharacterized proteins. In an archived primary melanoma tissue, DVP identified spatially resolved proteome changes as normal melanocytes transition to fully invasive melanoma, revealing pathways that change in a spatial manner as cancer progresses, such as mRNA splicing dysregulation in metastatic vertical growth that coincides with reduced interferon signaling and antigen presentation. The ability of DVP to retain precise spatial proteomic information in the tissue context has implications for the molecular profiling of clinical samples.",,,,,,2022-05-20 00:00:00,2022/05/19,2022/5/20,Andreas Mund;

Some of the most frequently activated oncogenes driving diverse cancers are c-MYC, EGFR, HER2, AKT, KRAS, BRAF, and MEK. Using a reductionist approach, we explored how cellular proteomes are remodeled in isogenic cell lines engineered with or without these driver oncogenes. The most striking discovery for all oncogenic models was the systematic downregulation of scores of antiviral proteins regulated by type 1 interferon. These findings extended to cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models of highly refractory pancreatic cancer and osteosarcoma driven by KRAS and MYC oncogenes. The oncogenes reduced basal expression of and autocrine stimulation by type 1 interferon causing remarkable convergence on common phenotypic and functional profiles. In particular, there was dramatically lower expression of dsRNA sensors including DDX58 (RIG-I) and OAS proteins, which resulted in attenuated functional responses when the oncogenic cells were treated with the dsRNA mimetic, polyI:C, and increased susceptibility to infection with an RNA virus shown using SARS-CoV-2.

To examine whether reduced production of endogenous PPARγ ligands would influence bone regeneration, we examined the effects of HSL knockout on fracture repair in mice using a tibial mono-cortical defect as a model. We found an improved rate of fracture repair in HSL-ko mice documented by serial μCT and bone histomorphometry compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, accelerated rates of bone regeneration were observed with a calvarial model where implantation of bone grafts from HSL-ko mice accelerated bone regeneration at the injury site. Further analysis revealed improved MSC differentiation down osteoblast and chondrocyte lineage with inhibition of HSL. MSC recruitment to the injury site was greater in HSL-ko mice than WT. Finally, we used single cell RNAseq to understand the osteoimmunological differences between WT and HSL-ko mice and found changes in the pre-osteoclast population.

Here, we created a CRISPRi library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain 3610. We show that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. We developed an image analysis algorithm to quantify biofilm colony wrinkling, which identified strains with high or low levels of wrinkling that were uncorrelated with extracellular matrix gene expression. We also designed a high-throughput screen for sensitive quantification of sporulation efficiency and performed the first screens of sporulation during essential gene knockdown. We found that all basal knockdowns of essential genes were competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but certain strains exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased wrinkling and inhibited sporulation. These results highlight the importance of essential genes in biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes.

Abstract ImportanceFor many bacteria, life typically involves growth in dense, three-dimensional communities called biofilms that contain cells with differentiated roles and are held together by extracellular matrix. To examine how gene function varies between non-biofilm and biofilm growth, we created a comprehensive library of strains using CRISPRi to knockdown expression of each essential gene in the model species Bacillus subtilis 3610, which can develop into a wrinkled biofilm structure or a spore capable of surviving harsh environments. This library enabled us to determine when gene essentiality depends on growth conditions. We also developed high-throughput assays and computational algorithms to identify essential genes involved in biofilm wrinkling and sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased the density of wrinkles, and also inhibited sporulation in a medium with generally lower sporulation levels. These findings indicate that essential processes such as fatty acid synthesis can play important and multifaceted roles in bacterial development.",,,biorxiv;2022.05.31.494136,1.0,new results,2022-05-31 00:00:00,05/31/2022,,Heidi A.

The identification of therapeutically relevant TCR-pMHC pairs is a significant bottleneck in the implementation of TCR-based immunotherapies but may be augmented by computational methodologies. The ability to computationally design TCRs to target a specific pMHC will require an automated integration of next-generation sequencing, protein-protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics (MD), and TCR ranking. We present a generic pipeline to evaluate patient-specific, sequence-based TCRs to a target pMHC. Using the three most frequently expressed TCRs from 16 colorectal cancer patients, we predicted the protein-protein structure of the TCRs to the target CEA peptide-MHC using Modeller and ColabFold. Then, these TCR-pMHC structures were compared by performing an automated molecular dynamics equilibration. ColabFold generates starting configurations that require, on average, a ~2.5X reduction in simulation time to equilibrate TCR-pMHC structures compared to Modeller. In addition, the structural differences between Modeller and ColabFold are demonstrated by an increase in root mean square deviation (~0.20 nm) between clusters of equilibrated configurations, which can impact the number of hydrogen bonds and Lennard-Jones contacts between the TCR and pMHC. Finally, we identify a TCR ranking criteria that may be used to prioritize TCRs for evaluation of in vitro immunogenicity.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.01.494331,1.0,new results,2022-06-01 00:00:00,06/01/2022,,Zachary A.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition.

Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment.

However, despite technological advances2,3 most studies of allosteric effects on function are conducted in heterologous environments2,4,5, limiting the discovery of allosteric mechanisms that rely on endogenous binding partners or posttranslational modifications to modulate activity. Here we report an approach that enables probing of new sites of allosteric regulation at residue-level resolution in essential eukaryotic proteins in their native biological context by comprehensive mutational scanning. We apply our approach to the central GTPase Gsp1/Ran. GTPases are highly regulated molecular switches that control signaling, with switching occurring via catalyzed GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. We find that 28% of 4,315 assayed mutations in Gsp1/Ran are highly deleterious, showing a toxic response identified by our assay as gain-of-function (GOF). Remarkably, a third of all positions enriched for GOF mutations (20/60) are outside the GTPase active site. Kinetic analysis shows that these distal sites are allosterically coupled to the active site, including a novel cluster of sites that alter the nucleotide preference of Gsp1 from GDP to GTP. We describe multiple distinct mechanisms by which allosteric mutations alter Gsp1/Ran cellular function by modulating GTPase switching.

Almost three decades ago, Tonerand Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, orherds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of theToner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve thegoverning equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developedformalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scatteringobstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results toanalytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature,moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on avariety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients anddynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatileincorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps ofparameter space.

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction.

We report that ZF-tMeCP2, a conjugate of MeCP2({Delta}aa13-71, 313-484)6 and the cell-permeant mini-protein ZF5.37-11, both binds DNA in a methylation-dependent manner and reaches the nucleus of model cell lines intact at concentrations above 700 nM. When delivered to live cells, ZF-tMeCP2 engages the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex and selectively represses transcription from methylated promoters. Efficient nuclear delivery of ZF-tMeCP2 relies on a unique endosomal escape portal provided by HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion. The Tat conjugate of MeCP2 (Tat-tMeCP2), evaluated for comparison, is degraded within the nucleus, is not selective for methylated promoters, and trafficks in a HOPS-independent manner.

A remarkable example of single-cell behavior is seen in the ciliate Lacrymaria olor, which hunts by striking its prey via rapid movements and protrusions of a slender neck, many times the size of the original cell body. This dynamics of the cell neck is powered by active injection of energy into this slender filamentous structure via a coat of cilia across its length and specialized cilia at the tip. How a cell can program this dynamical active filament to produce desirable behaviors like search and homing to a target remains unknown. By constructing a coupled active-elastic and hydrodynamic model of a slender filament with activity at the tip, here we uncover how cell behavior (filament shape dynamics) can be controlled via activity dynamics. Our model captures two key features of this system - dynamic activity patterns (extension and compression cycles) and active stresses that are uniquely aligned with the filament geometry - leading to a so-called ""follower force"" constraint. We show that active filaments under deterministic, time-varying follower forces display rich behaviors including periodic and aperiodic shape dynamics over long times. We further show that aperiodic dynamics occur due to a transition to chaos in regions of a biologically accessible parameter space. By further dissecting the non-linear dynamics of this active filament system, we discover a simple iterative map of filament shape that predicts long-term behavior. Lastly, using these iterative maps as a design tool, we demonstrate examples of how a cell could ""program"" filament behaviors by using frequency and amplitude modulated activity patterns. Overall, our results serve as a framework to mechanistically understand behavior in single cells such as L. olor and present a novel chaotic dynamical system in active elastohydrodynamics. Our work also offers a direct framework for designing programmable active matter systems using filament geometries.

Significance statementSingle-celled protozoa display remarkable animal-like behaviors without the aid of neurons. Mechanistically understanding how this dynamic behavior emerges from underlying physical and biochemical components is an outstanding challenge. In this work, using an active filament model, we uncover the fundamental non-linear dynamics and non-variational mechanics that underlie the complex behaviors of single cells like Lacrymaria olor. In doing so we discover a novel route to chaos in active elastohydrodynamic systems and the first-ever description of how chaos can drive single-cell behaviors. Lastly, we present a framework for how filament behaviors can be ""programmed"" using dynamic, modulated activity patterns. Overall our work provides mechanistic insights into single-cell behaviors and offers a new framework for the design of filamentous active matter systems to achieve diverse functions.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.05.494577,1.0,new results,2022-06-05 00:00:00,06/05/2022,,Deepak Krishnamurthy; Manu Prakash,"Krishnamurthy, D.; Prakash, M.","Department of Bioengineering, University of California; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Deepak Krishnamurthy, Department of Bioengineering, University of California], [Manu Prakash, Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University",,,,,,0

The Melo-3 atomizer caused direct AT2 cell toxicity, whereas the more popular Juul pod's aerosol did not have a detectable cytotoxic effect on AT2 cells. Juul nicotine aerosol also did not increase short-term susceptibility to viral infection. However, 3 days of exposure upregulated genes central to the generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carcinogen metabolism and downregulated key innate immune system genes related to cytokine and chemokine signaling.

Here we provide a detailed dissection of this using single-cell RNA-sequencing of 1.3M peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 120 individuals, longitudinally exposed to three different pathogens. These analyses indicate that cell-type-specificity is a more prominent factor than pathogen-specificity regarding contexts that affect how genetics influences gene expression (i.e., eQTL) and co-expression (i.e., co-expression QTL). In monocytes, the strongest responder to pathogen stimulations, 71.4% of the genetic variants whose effect on gene expression is influenced by pathogen exposure (i.e., response QTL) also affect the co-expression between genes. This indicates widespread, context-specific changes in gene expression level and its regulation that are driven by genetics. Pathway analysis on the CLEC12A gene that exemplifies cell-type-, exposure-time- and genetic-background-dependent co-expression interactions, shows enrichment of the interferon (IFN) pathway specifically at 3-h post-exposure in monocytes.

Here, we present the BioImage Model Zoo (https://bioimage.io): a community-driven, fully open resource where standardized pre-trained models can be shared, explored, tested, and downloaded for further adaptation or direct deployment in multiple end user-facing tools (e.g., ilastik, deepImageJ, QuPath, StarDist, ImJoy, ZeroCostDL4Mic, CSBDeep). To enable everyone to contribute and consume the Zoo resources, we provide a model standard to enable cross-compatibility, a rich list of example models and practical use-cases, developer tools, documentation, and the accompanying infrastructure for model upload, download and testing. Our contribution aims to lay the groundwork to make deep learning methods for microscopy imaging findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across software tools and platforms.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.07.495102,1.0,new results,2022-06-08 00:00:00,06/08/2022,,Wei Ouyang;

Gliding is thought to be powered by a thin layer of flowing filamentous (F)-actin1- 3 sandwiched between the plasma membrane and a myosin-coated4,5 inner membrane complex. How this surface actin layer drives the diverse apicomplexan gliding modes observed experimentally - helical, circular, and twirling6,7, and patch8, pendulum9, or rolling2 - presents a rich biophysical puzzle. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to track individual actin filaments and myosin complexes in live Toxoplasma gondii. Based on these data, we hypothesize that F-actin flows arise by self-organization, rather than following a microtubule-based template as previously believed. We develop a continuum model of emergent F-actin flow within the unusual confines provided by parasite geometry. In the presence of F-actin turnover, our model predicts the emergence of a steady-state mode in which actin transport is largely rearward. Removing actin turnover leads to actin patches that recirculate up and down the cell, a ""cyclosis"" that we observe experimentally for drug-stabilized actin bundles in live parasites. These findings provide a mechanism by which actin turnover governs a transition between distinct self-organized F-actin states, whose properties can account for the diverse gliding modes known to occur. More broadly, we illustrate how different forms of gliding motility can emerge as an intrinsic consequence of the self-organizing properties of F-actin flow in a confined geometry.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.08.495399,1.0,new results,2022-06-09 00:00:00,06/09/2022,,Christina L.

We analyzed epidemiological, serological, and phylogenomic data to investigate the drivers of the 2019 epidemic in Cambodia. Using epidemiological models fit to a 19-year national dataset, we identified an overall trend of declining annual force of infection (FOI) for dengue virus (DENV) in Cambodia, interspersed with FOI spikes corresponding to epidemic year caseloads that exceeded demographic predictions. We constructed time-resolved phylogenetic trees with 105 DENV genomes sequenced from the 2019 Cambodian epidemic, paired with historical Southeast Asian data, to document the first-recorded introduction of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype into Cambodia. This introduction yielded highly localized transmission and decreased genomic diversity when compared to endemic DENV-1, supporting the hypothesis of epidemic invasion. Introduction of this genetically distinct lineage into a population with limited prior immunity--paired with a spike in FOI--was a key driver of the 2019 Cambodian epidemic.

How TMEM95 plays a role in membrane fusion of sperm and eggs has remained elusive. Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino-acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for a specific, receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs and suggest that this interaction may have a role in facilitating membrane fusion.

Significance statementMembrane fusion of sperm and eggs is pivotal in sexual reproduction. Tmem95 knockout mice show male-specific sterility, but it was unknown how sperm TMEM95 facilitates membrane fusion with eggs. We show here that human TMEM95 binds eggs. Our crystal structure of TMEM95 suggests a region where this binding may occur. We develop monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that impair sperm-egg fusion but do not block sperm-egg binding. Thus, we propose that there is a receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs, and that this interaction may have a direct role in membrane fusion. Our work suggests avenues for the identification of the TMEM95 egg receptor and may enable the development of infertility treatments and contraceptives for humans.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.10.495573,1.0,new results,2022-06-10 00:00:00,06/10/2022,,Shaogeng Tang; Yonggang Lu; Will M.

While some cell size control mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated through studies of cultured cells, it is unclear if and how such mechanisms control cell size in an animal. For example, it was recently shown that RB, the retinoblastoma protein, was diluted by cell growth in G1 to promote size-dependence of the G1/S transition. However, it remains unclear to what extent the RB-dilution mechanism controls cell size in an animal. We therefore examined the contribution of RB-dilution to cell size control in the mouse liver. The RB-dilution model has two requirements. First, manipulations changing RB concentration drive corresponding changes in cell size, and second, the endogenous RB concentration decreases with cell size in G1. We found that both these requirements were met. Genetic perturbations decreasing RB protein concentrations through inducible shRNA expression or through liverspecific Rb1 knockout reduced hepatocyte size, while perturbations increasing RB protein concentrations in an Fah-/- mouse model increased hepatocyte size. Moreover, RB concentration decreased in larger G1 hepatocytes while the concentrations of the cell cycle activators Cyclin D1 and E2f1 remained relatively constant. Lastly, we tested how Rb1 manipulations affected G1/S cell size control in primary hepatocytes using live cell imaging. Loss of Rb1 weakened cell size control, i.e., reduced the inverse correlation between how much cells grew in G1 and how large they were at birth. Taken together, our results show that an RB- dilution mechanism contributes to cell size control in the mouse liver by linking cell growth to the G1/S transition.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.08.495371,1.0,new results,2022-06-10 00:00:00,06/10/2022,,Shuyuan Zhang; Evgeny Zatulovskiy; Julia Arand; Julien Sage; Jan M.

APOBEC3 enzymes can act as potent host genome mutagens in multiple cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)3,4. There are seven human APOBEC3 family members (APOBEC3A-H) and all but one (G) preferentially deaminate TC dinucleotide substrates3. In patients, both APOBEC3A (A3A)5 and APOBEC3B (A3B)6 have been implicated to play a major role in NSCLC3. In this study, the impact of A3B on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancer evolution was assessed. EGFR mutant NSCLC mouse models containing a human A3B transgene7 were generated, and the effect of enforced A3B expression was evaluated at multiple timepoints. Enforced A3B expression was detrimental to tumour initiation and progression in the absence of targeted therapy due to elevated chromosomal instability (CIN) and p53 activation, which increased significantly in tumours with A3B expression. This finding was substantiated in the TRACERx421 study demonstrating a significant correlation between CIN and A3B in patients with NSCLC. In contrast, A3B expression with targeted therapy resulted in a significant increase in treatment resistance in mouse models and human preclinical models of EGFR mutant lung cancer. In specimens collected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma, targeted therapy upregulated A3B expression, and induced significantly more APOBEC-associated mutations including variants associated with therapy resistance. Analyses of human NSCLC models revealed that targeted therapy induced A3B upregulation in part via treatment-mediated activation of nuclear factor (NF)-{kappa}B signalling, and downregulation of the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG). This study uncovers the multifaceted roles of A3B on tumour evolution and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable responses to targeted cancer therapy.",,,biorxiv;2020.12.18.423280,3.0,new results,2022-06-11 00:00:00,06/11/2022,,Deborah R.

Molecular mimicry empowers pathogens to subvert critical host processes and establish infection. We report that the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila secretes the toxin SidI (substrate of icm/dot transporter I), which possesses a transfer RNA (tRNA)-like shape and functions as a mannosyl transferase. The 3.1 [A] cryo-EM structure of SidI reveals an N-terminal domain that exhibits a characteristic  inverted L-shape and charge distribution that is present in two other known protein mimics of tRNAs, the bacterial elongation factor EF-G and the mammalian release factor eRF1. In addition, we show that SidIs C-terminal domain adopts a glycosyl transferase B fold similar to a mannosyl transferase. This molecular coupling of the proteins fold and enzymatic function allows SidI to bind and glycosylate components of the host translation apparatus, including the ribosome, resulting in a robust block of protein synthesis that is comparable in potency to ricin, one of the most powerful toxins known. Additionally, we find that translational pausing activated by SidI elicits a stress response signature reminiscent of the ribotoxic stress response that is activated by elongation inhibitors that induce ribosome collisions. SidI-mediated effects on the ribosome activate the stress kinases ZAK and p38, which in turn drive an accumulation of the protein activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Intriguingly, ATF3 escapes the translation block imposed by SidI, translocates to the nucleus, and orchestrates the transcription of stress-inducible genes that promote cell death. Thus, using Legionella and its effectors as tools, we have unravelled the role of a ribosome-to-nuclear signalling pathway that regulates cell fate.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.10.495705,3.0,new results,2022-06-12 00:00:00,06/12/2022,,Advait Subramanian; Lan Wang; Tom Moss; Mark Voorhies; Smriti Sangwan; Erica Stevenson; Ernst H.

Although microelectrodes have been developed for long-term electrophysiological interfaces with neural tissue, studies of long-term interfaces between microelectrodes and free-floating organoids remain limited. In this study, we report a stretchable, soft mesh electrode system that establishes an intimate in vitro electrical interface with human neurons in 3D organoids. Our mesh is constructed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based electrically conductive hydrogel electrode arrays and an elastomeric poly(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (SEBS) as the substrate and encapsulation materials. This mesh electrode can maintain stable electrochemical impedance in buffer solution under 50% compressive and 50% tensile strain. We have successfully cultured pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical organoids (hCO) on this polymeric mesh for more than 3 months and demonstrated that organoids readily integrate with the mesh. Using simultaneous stimulation and calcium imaging, we show that electrical stimulation through the mesh can elicit intensity-dependent calcium signals comparable to stimulation from a bipolar stereotrode. This platform may serve as a tool for monitoring and modulating the electrical activity of in vitro models of neuropsychiatric diseases.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.10.495715,1.0,new results,2022-06-13 00:00:00,06/13/2022,,Thomas L.

Current computational methods identify and measure the spatial relationships between cell-types, but do not leverage the spatial information of individual RNA molecules to reveal subcellular spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA processing. Here, we developed Bento, a computational framework for subcellular analysis of high-throughput spatial transcriptomics datasets. Bento handles single-molecule data generated by diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies and computes spatial statistics of subcellular RNA molecular distributions, compartmental expression, and cell morphology to build multidimensional feature sets for exploratory analysis. We also developed a multi-label ensemble model for generalizable classification of subcellular localization of every gene in every cell. To demonstrate Bentos utility, we applied it to analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by seqFISH+ (10k genes in [~]200 fibroblast cells) and MERFISH (130 genes quantified in [~]1000 U2-OS cells) to understand the interplay between gene function, cellular morphology and RNA localization. To understand the role of RNA localization in RNA processing, we integrated spatial data with RNA binding protein (RBP) binding data to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of RBP-RNA interactions at unprecedented scale (3,165 RNA species x 148 RBPs). We found RNA targets of individual RBPs to be enriched in specific subcellular compartments - such as Splicing Factor 3a Protein Complex (SF3A3), and that preferential localization is influenced by RBP binding of genomic regions for RBPs including Staufen homolog 2 (STAU2). Bento builds on the existing ecosystem of single-cell and spatial analysis toolkits, to ensure accessibility and community-driven tool development. We provide Bento as an open-source tool for the community to further expand our understanding of subcellular biology.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.10.495510,1.0,new results,2022-06-13 00:00:00,06/13/2022,,Clarence K.

However, these heterologous enzymes can suffer from low activity, specificity, stability and solubility in yeast, resulting in arduous iterations of design-build-test-learn cycles to optimize their production often performed on a single enzyme basis. Laboratory directed evolution has proven to be a powerful and high-throughput method for protein engineering, albeit its limited application for biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we harness small molecule-sensing, RNA-based switches to develop a generalizable selection system facilitating enzyme evolution. Our design utilizes an RNA-based switch for detection of intracellular compound production, which then regulates the expression of a selection gene. Our initial data shows that the auxotrophy selection gene SpHIS5 exhibits the highest selective capability in combination with a theophylline-responsive RNA-based switch. Using the theophylline-responsive RNA-based switch, we demonstrated the enrichment of a high-producing variant of caffeine demethylase, in a population size of 103.

While we can alter an organoid's morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid's morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids.

Here we found in fruit fly embryos that the cytoplasm can compartmentalize and divide without nuclei. Our targeted screen for potential necessary and sufficient conditions revealed that, although the cytoplasmic compartments are tightly associated with centrosomes, they can form without astral microtubules and divide without centrioles. Although a focal pool of microtubules is necessary for maintaining cytoplasmic compartments, this is not sufficient for their initial formation. Actin filaments are similarly an essential component of cytoplasmic compartments; however, their myosin II-based contractility is unexpectedly dispensable for divisions. We show that the myosin II-based contractility is instead involved in regulating the pace of these divisions. Importantly, our results revealed that the cytoplasmic divisions without nuclei can occur in a periodic manner autonomously of the Cdk-Cyclin oscillator that normally drives the cell cycle. We demonstrate that such autonomy of cytoplasmic divisions is preserved even in normal development, where it is leveraged to extrude mitotically delayed nuclei from the blastoderm, protecting the synchrony of rapid nuclear divisions against local delays in mitotic entry. We propose that an active coordination between otherwise autonomous cycles of cytoplasmic and nuclear divisions acts as a quality control mechanism for genome integrity and partitioning in development.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.15.496343,1.0,new results,2022-06-16 00:00:00,06/16/2022,,Anand Bakshi; Fabio Echegaray Iturra; Andrew Alamban; Miquel Rosas-Salvans; Sophie Dumont; Mustafa G.

Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity.

Here, we present MIDAS2, which addresses the computational challenges presented by increasingly large reference genome databases, while adding functionality for building custom databases and leveraging paired-end reads to improve SNV accuracy. This fast and scalable reengineering of the MIDAS pipeline enables thousands of metagenomic samples to be efficiently genotyped.

Surface-enhancedRaman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning (ML) can distinguish multiplepathogen species and strains, but processing complex fluid samples tosensitively and specifically detect pathogens remains an outstanding challenge.Here, we develop an acoustic bioprinting platform to digitize samples intomillions of droplets, each containing just a few cells, which are thenidentified with SERS and ML. As a proof of concept, we focus on bacterialbloodstream infections. We demonstrate rapid, kHz-rate printing of ~2pLdroplets from solutions containing S. epidermidi, E. coli, and mouse red bloodcells (RBCs); when mixed with gold nanorods (GNRs), SERS enhancements of up to1500x are achieved. With this improved signal-to-noise, we train an ML model ondroplets consisting of either pure cells or mixed, multicellular species. Weachieve >=99% classification accuracy of droplets printed from cellularly-puresamples, and >=87% accuracy in droplets printed from cellularly-mixed samples.We also determine the most significant SERS bands for classification anddemonstrate that they correspond to biologically relevant vibrational modeswithin our cells.

The anterior of the cell is marked by an array of cilia, known as the oral apparatus, which can be induced to shed and regenerate in a series of reproducible morphological steps, previously shown to require transcription. If a cell is cut in half, each half will regenerate an intact cell, including a new oral apparatus in the posterior half. We used RNAseq to assay the dynamic changes in Stentors transcriptome during regeneration, after both oral apparatus shedding and bisection, allowing us to identify distinct temporal waves of gene expression including kinases, RNA binding proteins, centriole biogenesis factors, and orthologs of human ciliopathy genes implicated in Meckel and Joubert syndromes. By comparing transcriptional profiles of different regeneration events in the same species, we were able to identify distinct modules of gene expression corresponding to oral apparatus regeneration, posterior holdfast regeneration, and recovery after wounding. By measuring gene expression in cells in which translation is blocked, we show that the sequential waves of gene expression involve a cascade mechanism in which later waves of expression are triggered by translation products of early-expressed genes. Among the early-expressed genes, we identified an E2F transcription factor and the conserved RNA binding protein Pumilio as potential regulators of regeneration based on the expression pattern of their predicted target genes. RNAi mediated knockdown experiments indicate that Pumilio is required for regenerating oral structures of the correct size. We show that E2F is involved in the completion of regeneration but is dispensable for earlier steps. This work allows us to classify regeneration genes into groups based on their potential role for regeneration in distinct cell regeneration paradigms, and provides insight into how a single cell can coordinate complex morphogenetic pathways to regenerate missing structures.",,,biorxiv;2021.06.23.449623,3.0,new results,2022-06-19 00:00:00,06/19/2022,,Pranidhi Sood; Athena Lin; Connie Yan; Rebecca McGillivary; Ulises Diaz; Tatyana Makushok; Wallace F.

Here, we interrogated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate NK cell recognition and lysis of infected cells. We found that NK cells exhibit poor cytotoxic responses against SARS-CoV-2-infected targets, preferentially killing uninfected bystander cells. We demonstrate that this escape is driven by downregulation of ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D (""NKG2D-L""). Indeed, early in viral infection, prior to NKG2D-L downregulation, NK cells are able to target and kill infected cells; however, this ability is lost as viral proteins are expressed. Finally, we found that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) mediates downregulation of NKG2D-L and that Nsp1 alone is sufficient to confer resistance to NK cell killing. Collectively, our work reveals that SARS-CoV-2 evades NK cell cytotoxicity and describes a mechanism by which this occurs.

To inform Lesothos national rollout of PrEP to the general population, this research aimed to characterize knowledge and attitudes towards PrEP among policy makers, implementing partners, healthcare providers, and PrEP end-users in Lesotho. Respondents were purposively selected to participate based on personal experience in the development and implementation of Lesothos PrEP program, or the personal use of PrEP. We conducted 106 in-depth interviews with policy makers (n=5), implementing partners (n=4), and end-users (current PrEP users = 55; former PrEP users = 36; and PrEP ""decliners"" = 6). In addition, we held 11 focus group discussions (FGDs) with a total of 105 healthcare providers. Interview and FGD transcripts were analyzed following the tenets of Grounded Theory. Respondents expressed positive attitudes towards PrEP, owing to experienced and perceived personal, familial, and societal benefits. PrEP was viewed as i) an opportunity for serodiscordant couples to remain together, ii) a means of conceiving children with minimized risk of HIV infection, iii) providing a sense of agency and control, and iv) an avenue for addressing the HIV epidemic in Lesotho. Respondents demonstrated understanding of PrEPs intended use, eligibility requirements, and modality of use. However, they also reported that several important misconceptions of PrEP were common among adults in Lesotho, including the belief that PrEP protects against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, promotes promiscuity, prevents pregnancy, causes seroconversion, and provides lifelong protection from taking the pill just once. In addition to building on the perceived advantages of PrEP to shape a positive message, Lesothos national rollout of PrEP will likely benefit from a communication strategy that specifically addresses the common misconceptions of PrEP identified in this study.",,,medrxiv;2022.06.21.22276722,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-06-22 00:00:00,06/22/2022,,Pascal Geldsetzer; Joy J.

A specific gain of function pathogenic variant in CACNA1C causes Timothy syndrome type 1 (TS1) with cardiac long QT syndrome, syndactyly, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Recent case series highlighted a broader spectrum of CACNA1C-related disorder (CRD) that includes isolated cardiac disease, isolated neurologic deficits, and TS, but it is unknown how the clinical presentation of other CRD variants relate to neural defects. We surveyed individuals with CRD to define the neuropsychiatric and developmental phenotype in an effort to guide future research into the role of calcium channels in neural development. Among 24 participants the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms and/or diagnoses were developmental delay in 92%, incoordination in 71%, hypotonia in 67%, autism spectrum disorder in 50% (autistic features in 92%), seizures in 38%, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 21% of participants. There were no significant differences in symptoms between participants with and without long QT syndrome.

A recently discovered novel family of lipid transfer proteins, which includes the VPS13 proteins (VPS13A-D), adopt a rod-like bridge conformation with an extended hydrophobic groove that enables the bulk transfer of membrane lipids for membrane growth. Loss of function mutations in VPS13A and VPS13C cause chorea acanthocytosis and Parkinsons disease, respectively. VPS13A and VPS13C localize to multiple organelle contact sites, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - lipid droplet (LD) contact sites, but the functional roles of these proteins in LD regulation remains mostly unexplored. Here, we employ CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate VPS13A and VPS13C knockout cell lines in U-2 OS cells via deletion of exon 2 and introduction of an early frameshift. Analysis of LD content in these cell lines revealed that loss of either VPS13A or VPS13C results in reduced LD abundance under oleate-stimulated conditions. These data implicate VPS13A and VPS13C in LD regulation and raise the intriguing possibility that VPS13A and VPS13C-mediated lipid transfer facilitates LD biogenesis.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.21.497109,1.0,new results,2022-06-23 00:00:00,06/23/2022,,Shuliang Chen; Melissa A.

Interestingly, actin does not assemble at all CME sites in mammalian cells. How actin networks are organized with respect to mammalian CME sites and how assembly forces are harnessed, are not fully understood. Here, branched actin network geometry at CME sites was analyzed using three different advanced imaging approaches. When endocytic dynamics of unperturbed CME sites are compared, sites with actin assembly show a distinct signature, a delay between completion of coat expansion and vesicle scission, indicating that actin assembly occurs preferentially at stalled CME sites. In addition, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are recruited to one side of CME sites, where they are positioned to stimulate asymmetric actin assembly and force production. We propose that actin assembles preferentially at stalled CME sites where it pulls vesicles into the cell asymmetrically, much as a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap.",,,,,,2022-06-23 00:00:00,2022/06/22,2022/6/23,Meiyan Jin; Cyna Shirazinejad; Bowen Wang; Amy Yan; Johannes Schöneberg; Srigokul Upadhyayula; Ke Xu; David G Drubin,,"Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. drubin@berkeley.edu.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.","Meiyan Jin: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Cyna Shirazinejad: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.Bowen Wang: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Amy Yan: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Johannes Schöneberg: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.Srigokul Upadhyayula: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Ke Xu: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.David G Drubin: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. drubin@berkeley.edu.",,,,,,0

Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the near-complete 16,740 nt genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses--HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)--but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the viruss potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover.

ImportanceHenipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus which likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.12.495793,2.0,new results,2022-06-24 00:00:00,06/24/2022,,Sharline Madera; Amy Kistler; Hafaliana C.

Using synthetic biology, we engineered T cells with a chimeric receptor SyNthetic Intramembrane Proteolysis Receptor (SNIPR) that induces overexpression of an exogenous reporter gene cassette upon recognition of specific tumor markers. We then applied a SNIPR-based positron emission tomography (PET) reporter system to two cancer-relevant antigens, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), commonly expressed in breast and glial tumors respectively. Antigen-specific reporter induction of the SNIPR-PET T cells was confirmed in vitro using GFP fluorescence, luciferase luminescence, and the HSV-TK PET reporter with [18F]FHBG. T cells associated with their target antigens were successfully imaged using PET in dual xenograft HER2+/HER2- and EGFRvIII+/EGFRvIII-animal models, with > 10-fold higher [18F]FHBG signals seen in antigen-expressing tumors versus the corresponding controls.

When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.",Arp2/3 complex; actin; amoeboid motility; cell biology; cell mechanics; cytoskeleton; force generation; load adaptation; none,,,,,2022-06-25 00:00:00,2022/06/24,2022/6/25,Tai-De Li; Peter Bieling; Julian Weichsel; R Dyche Mullins; Daniel A Fletcher,,"Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Advanced Science Research Center, City University of New York, New York, United States.; Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Systemic Cell Biology, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany.","Tai-De Li: Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Advanced Science Research Center, City University of New York, New York, United States.Peter Bieling: Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Systemic Cell Biology, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany.Julian Weichsel: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.R Dyche Mullins: Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.Daniel A Fletcher: Department of Bioengineering & Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Division of Biological Systems & Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, United States.",,,10.1101/2021.05.24.445507,,,0

Almost three decades ago, Toner and Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, or herds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challenge faced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is the complex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic and microscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grass plains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problems analytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of the Toner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve the governing equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developed formalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scattering obstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results to analytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature, moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on a variety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients and dynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatile incorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps of parameter space. Looking forward, the work presented here lays the groundwork for a dialogue between Toner-Tu theory and data on collective motion in biologically-relevant geometries, from drone footage of migrating animal herds to movies of microscopic cytoskeletal flows within cells.",,,biorxiv;2022.06.22.497052,1.0,new results,2022-06-25 00:00:00,06/25/2022,,Christina L.

After optimization, top-performing barcodes had ∼10-fold increased capacity relative to the best random-screened designs and performed reliably across diverse cell types. DAISY barcode arrays generated ∼12 bits of entropy and ∼66,000 unique barcodes. Thus, DAISY barcodes-at a fraction of the size of Cas9 barcodes-achieved high-capacity barcoding. We coupled DAISY barcoding with single-cell RNA-seq to recover lineages and gene expression profiles from ∼47,000 human melanoma cells. A single DAISY barcode recovered up to ∼700 lineages from one parental cell. This analysis revealed heritable single-cell gene expression and potential epigenetic modulation of memory gene transcription. Overall, Cas12a DAISY barcoding is an efficient tool for investigating cell-state dynamics.",CRISPR barcoding; Cas12a; PRC2; high throughput screening; lineage tracking; machine learning; melanoma; online learning optimization; single cell genomics; transcriptional memory,,,,,2022-06-26 00:00:00,2022/06/24,2022/6/26,Nicholas W Hughes; Yuanhao Qu; Jiaqi Zhang; Weijing Tang; Justin Pierce; Chengkun Wang; Aditi Agrawal; Maurizio Morri; Norma Neff; Monte M Winslow; Mengdi Wang; Le Cong,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA; Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA; Center for Statistics and Machine Learning, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.

Towards this goal, we deployed a customized P. falciparum PhIP-seq T7 phage display library containing 238,068 tiled 62-amino acid peptides, covering all known coding regions, including antigenic variants, to systematically profile antibody targets in 198 Ugandan children and adults from high and moderate transmission settings. Repeat elements - short amino acid sequences repeated within a protein - were significantly enriched in antibody targets. While breadth of responses to repeat-containing peptides was twofold higher in children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting, no such differences were observed for peptides without repeats, suggesting that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions may be more exposure dependent and/or less durable in children than responses to regions without repeats. Additionally, short motifs associated with seroreactivity were extensively shared among hundreds of antigens, potentially representing cross- reactive epitopes. PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens, partly driven by the diversity of PfEMP1 sequences.

The parasite evades clearance by the host immune system through antigenic variation of its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, periodically ""switching"" expression of the VSG using a large genomic repertoire of VSG-encoding genes. Studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream, but recent work has shown that many, if not most, parasites are extravascular and reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues. However, it is unknown whether parasites undergo antigenic variation while in extravascular spaces. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Our experiments show that the expressed VSG repertoire is not uniform across populations of parasites within the same infection and that a greater number of VSGs are expressed in tissue spaces than in the blood. More than 75% of the VSGs detected in an animal were found exclusively within extravascular spaces. Interestingly, we also noticed a delay in the VSG-specific clearance of parasites in tissue spaces compared to the blood. This finding aligns with a model in which parasites ""hide"" from the immune system in tissue spaces, where a slower immune response provides them with more time to generate new antigenic variants.

Microbial pangenomes are created by aggregating all genomes of a single clade and reflect the metabolic diversity of groups of organisms. As de novo metagenome analysis techniques have matured and reference genome databases have expanded, metapangenome analysis has risen in popularity as a tool to organize the functional potential of organisms in relation to the environment from which those organisms were sampled. However, the reliance on assembly and binning or on reference databases often leaves substantial portions of metagenomes unanalyzed, thereby underestimating the functional potential of a community. To address this challenge, we present a method for metapangenomics that relies on amino acid k-mers (kaa-mers) and metagenome assembly graph queries. To enable this method, we first show that kaa-mers estimate pangenome characteristics and that open reading frames can be accurately predicted from short shotgun sequencing reads using the previously developed tool orpheum. These techniques enable pangenomics to be performed directly on short sequencing reads. To enable metapangenome analysis, we combine these approaches with compact de Bruijn assembly graph queries to directly generate sets of sequencing reads for a specific species from a metagenome.

While some progress has been made in selecting highly specific aptamers, the discovery of these reagents remains slow and costly. In this work, we demonstrate a novel strategy to distinguish molecules with miniscule difference in chemical composition (such as a single hydroxyl group) - with cross reactive aptamer probes - by tuning the charge state of the surface on which the aptamer probes are immobilized. As an exemplar, we show that our strategy can distinguish between DOX and many structurally similar analytes, including its primary metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol).

Motivated by this, we propose a novel task, datasetexplanation. Given two image data sets, dataset explanation aims toautomatically point out their dataset-level distribution shifts with naturallanguage. Current techniques for monitoring distribution shifts provideinadequate information to understand datasets with the goal of improving dataquality. Therefore, we introduce GSCLIP, a training-free framework to solve thedataset explanation task. In GSCLIP, we propose the selector as the firstquantitative evaluation method to identify explanations that are proper tosummarize dataset shifts. Furthermore, we leverage this selector to demonstratethe superiority of a generator based on language model generation. Systematicevaluation on natural data shift verifies that GSCLIP, a combined system of ahybrid generator group and an efficient selector is not only easy-to-use butalso powerful for dataset explanation at scale.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15007,arXiv:2206.15007v1,,,06/30/2022,06/30/2022,,Zhiying Zhu; Weixin Liang; James Zou,,,,,,,,,1

A key component to this is that global transcription rates increase in larger cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we identify RNAPII as the major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size in budding yeast as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the general transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content. This drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is precisely compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge. Thus, limiting RNAPII and feedback on mRNA stability work in concert to ensure mRNA concentration homeostasis in growing cells.",,,biorxiv;2021.09.20.461005,2.0,new results,2022-07-01 00:00:00,07/01/2022,,Matthew P.

Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (""metagenotyping"").
C_LIO_LIMicrobial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.

We hypothesized that phyllosphere interactions may be disrupted in a greenhouse setting, where microbial dispersal is limited, and that adding a microbial amendment might yield important benefits to the host plant.
C_LIO_LIUsing a newly developed synthetic phyllosphere microbiome for Tomato, we tested this hypothesis across multiple trials by manipulating microbial colonization of leaves and measuring subsequent plant growth and reproductive success, comparing results from plants grown in both greenhouse and field settings.
C_LIO_LIWe confirmed that greenhouse-grown plants have a depauperate phyllosphere microbiome and that the addition of the synthetic microbial community was responsible for a clear and repeatable increase in fruit production in this setting. We further show that this effect is synergistic with the addition of micronutrient-based soil amendments, with important implications for agriculture.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that greenhouse environments have poor phyllosphere microbiome establishment, with negative impacts on the plant. The results also implicate the phyllosphere microbiome as a key component of plant fitness, emphasizing that these communities have a clear role to play in the ecology and evolution of plant communities.

Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.01.498451,1.0,new results,2022-07-03 00:00:00,07/03/2022,,Nicholas C.

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission.

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naive mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) - two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.

DiMeLo-seq maps multiple interaction sites on single DNA molecules, profiles protein binding in the context of endogenous DNA methylation, and maps protein-DNA interactions in repetitive regions of the genome that are difficult to study with short-read methods. Adenines in the vicinity of a protein of interest are methylated in situ by tethering the Hia5 methyltransferase to an antibody using protein A. Protein-DNA interactions are then detected by direct readout of adenine methylation with long-read, single-molecule, DNA sequencing platforms such as Nanopore sequencing. Here, we present a detailed protocol and guidance for performing DiMeLo-seq. This protocol can be run on nuclei from fresh, lightly fixed, or frozen cells. The protocol requires 1 day for performing in situ targeted methylation, 1-5 days for library preparation depending on desired fragment length, and 1-3 days for Nanopore sequencing depending on desired sequencing depth. The protocol requires basic molecular biology skills and equipment, as well as access to a Nanopore sequencer.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.",genetic drift; natural selection; separation of timescales; spatial structure,,,,,2022-07-06 00:00:00,2022/07/05,2022/7/6,Olivia M Ghosh; Benjamin H Good,,"Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.","Olivia M Ghosh: Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Benjamin H Good: Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.",,,,,,0

High doses of intravenously-delivered vector are required to reach the CNS, which has resulted in varying adverse effects. Moreover, selective transduction of various cell types might be important depending on the disorder being treated. To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids. We identified the amino acid (aa) from region 451-470 of AAV2 associated with the capsids selected for neurons, and a combination of aa from regions 413-496 of AAV-rh10 and 538-598 of AAV3B/LK03 associated with capsids selected for astrocytes. An siRNA screen identified several genes that affect transcytosis of AAV across the BBB.

The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response.

Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs.

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population. Comorbid lung disease and lower levels of initial IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen were associated with longer symptom duration.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04373148.FUNDINGNIH UL1TR003142 CTSA grant, NIH U54CA260517 grant, NIEHS R21 ES03304901, Sean N Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sunshine Foundation, Crown Foundation, and Parker Foundation.",Immunoglobulins; Infectious disease,,,,,2022-07-09 00:00:00,2022/07/08,2022/7/9,Xiaolin Jia; Shu Cao; Alexandra S Lee; Monali Manohar; Sayantani B Sindher; Neera Ahuja; Maja Artandi; Catherine A Blish; Andra L Blomkalns; Iris Chang; William J Collins; Manisha Desai; Hena Naz Din; Evan Do; Andrea Fernandes; Linda N Geng; Yael Rosenberg-Hasson; Megan Ruth Mahoney; Abigail L Glascock; Lienna Y Chan; Sharon Y Fong; CLIAHUB Consortium; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Maira Phelps; Olivia Raeber; Stanford COVID-19 Biobank Study Group; Natasha Purington; Katharina Röltgen; Angela J Rogers; Theo Snow; Taia T Wang; Daniel Solis; Laura Vaughan; Michelle Verghese; Holden Maecker; Richard Wittman; Rajan Puri; Amy Kistler; Samuel Yang; Scott D Boyd; Benjamin A Pinsky; Sharon Chinthrajah; Kari C Nadeau,,"; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine.; Sean N.

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.",,,,,,2022-07-09 00:00:00,2022/07/08,2022/7/9,Eran Mick;

Whether ferroptosis sensitivity is governed by a single regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, based on the integration of 24 published chemical genetic screens combined with targeted follow-up experimentation, we find that the genetic regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity is highly variable and context-dependent. For example, the lipid metabolic gene acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) appears far more essential for ferroptosis triggered by direct inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) than by cystine deprivation. Despite this, distinct pro-ferroptotic stimuli converge upon a common lethal effector mechanism: accumulation of lipid peroxides at the plasma membrane.

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.",,,,,,2022-07-12 00:00:00,2022/07/11,2022/7/12,Jacob W Freimer;

To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.

Significance StatementParasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data. Combined, the results provide new information on how these important parasites accomplish the essential step of invasion.",,,biorxiv;2022.01.12.476068,2.0,new results,2022-07-13 00:00:00,07/13/2022,,Li-av Segev-Zarko; Peter D.

Unfortunately, despite more thantwenty years of theoretical efforts following the experimental discovery ofmemory and rejuvenation, these effects have thus far been impossible tosimulate reliably. Yet, three recent developments convinced us to accept thischallenge: first, the custom-built Janus II supercomputer makes it possible tocarry out ""numerical experiments"" in which the very same quantities that can bemeasured in single crystals of CuMn are computed from the simulation, allowingfor parallel analysis of the simulation/experiment data. Second, Janus IIsimulations have taught us how numerical and experimental length scales shouldbe compared. Third, we have recently understood how temperature chaosmaterializes in aging dynamics. All three aspects have proved crucial forreliably reproducing rejuvenation and memory effects on the computer.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.",Ets; Ets21C; blastema; gene regulatory network; imaginal disc; regeneration; scRNA-seq; tissue damage; transcription factor; tumors,,,,,2022-07-13 00:00:00,2022/07/11,2022/7/13,Melanie I Worley; Nicholas J Everetts; Riku Yasutomi; Rebecca J Chang; Shrey Saretha; Nir Yosef; Iswar K Hariharan,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.16.500284,1.0,new results,2022-07-16 00:00:00,07/16/2022,,Brent Townshend; Matias Kaplan; Christina D.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3 s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.15.499945,1.0,new results,2022-07-16 00:00:00,07/16/2022,,Amos J.

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases. In summary, our findings suggest that integrating host transcriptional profiling and broad-range metagenomic pathogen detection from nucleic acid may hold promise as a tool for sepsis diagnosis.",,,medrxiv;2022.07.16.22277700,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-07-17 00:00:00,07/17/2022,,Katrina Kalantar; Lucile Neyton; Mazin Abdelghany; Eran Mick; Alejandra Jauregui; Saharai Caldera; Paula Hayakawa Serpa; Rajani Ghale; Jack Albright; Aartik Sarma; Alexandra Tsitsiklis; Aleksandra Leligdowicz; Stephanie Christenson; Kathleen Liu; Kirsten Kangelaris; Carolyn Hendrickson; Pratik Sinha; Antonio Gomez; Norma Neff; Angela Pisco; Sarah Doernberg; Joseph L.

In this work we combined single cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing to better understand fate-choice in human B cells. Using the antibody sequence to trace cell lineage during in vitro differentiation, we identified intrinsic proliferative and cell fate biases of B cell subtypes. Clonal analysis revealed that IgM memory B cells were more proliferative than any other B cell subtype, and that cells from the same clone had highly concordant fates. We found that transcriptional memory within clones varies across genes, with strongest persistence in genes related to cell fate determination. Similar persistent transcriptional programs were observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, suggesting that these programs maintain long-term cell fate in vivo. These results show that cell-intrinsic fate bias influences human B cell differentiation and reveal molecular programs underpinning cell fate determination in B cells.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.14.499766,2.0,new results,2022-07-19 00:00:00,07/19/2022,,Michael Swift; Felix Horns; Stephen R.

Manual sample preparation remains a slow, expensive, and error-prone process. Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts - RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (-11x), cost (-3x), and biohazardous waste produced (-4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total). This pipeline is also generalizable for many nucleic acid extraction applications, thereby increasing the scale of studies, which can be performed in small research labs.",,,biorxiv;2020.08.18.256545,3.0,new results,2022-07-19 00:00:00,07/19/2022,,Mira N.

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale. In contrast, we detected evidence for RuBisCO throughout the water column and sediments, including form II/III and form III-related enzymes encoded by CPR bacteria in the water column and DPANN archaea in the sediments. Overall, CPR bacteria and phages did not show strong signals of gene content differentiation by depth, despite the fact that distinct species groups populate different lake and sediment compartments. Thus, environmental gradients in Lac Pavin probably select for the capacities of CPR bacteria and phages to a lesser extent than other bacteria and archaea, possibly because selection on the former groups is indirect and depends on host characteristics.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.18.500538,1.0,new results,2022-07-19 00:00:00,07/19/2022,,Alexander L.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.","

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.",adaptation; differentiation; extrusion; feedback; stem cells; tissue homeostasis,,,,,2022-07-20 00:00:00,2022/07/18,2022/7/20,Lucy Erin O'Brien,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; email: lucye@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.","Lucy Erin O'Brien: Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; email: lucye@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.",,,,,,0

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.",,,,,,2022-07-21 00:00:00,2022/07/20,2022/7/21,Carlos F Buen Abad Najar; Prakruthi Burra; Nir Yosef; Liana F Lareau,,"Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.","Carlos F Buen Abad Najar: Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.Prakruthi Burra: Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.Nir Yosef: Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.Liana F Lareau: Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.",,,,,,0

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects.

Forty-two individuals had no known deficiency of B cell immunity and a normal antibody response to the vaccine. Among them, ten (24%) had auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs (aged 43-86 years). Eight of these ten patients had auto-Abs neutralizing both IFN-α2 and IFN-ω, while two neutralized IFN-ω only. No patient neutralized IFN-β.

Under such conditions, the standard assumption about theequivalence of the most standard protocols (i.e.,\it{no big difference betweenswitching the field on or off}, as it is sometimes said) is not reallyjustified. In fact, we show here that the spin-glass coherence length behavesdifferently in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC, magnetic field is turned on) andthermoremanent-magnetization (TRM, magnetic field is turned off) protocols.This conclusion is reached through experiments, carried out on two CuMnsingle-crystal samples, and through massive simulations on the Janus~IIdedicated supercomputer. In agreement with the predictions of a simpledynamical model that assumes that the ultrametric tree of states survives theswitching-on of the magnetic field, we conclude that (all parameters being keptequal) the spin-glass coherence length is larger in the ZFC protocol. This hasimplications for the extended principle of superposition, which, while holdingat $H = 0$, breaks down for finite magnetic fields. Preliminary simulationresults support this observation.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10640,arXiv:2207.10640v2,,,07/21/2022,07/21/2022,,I. Paga; Q. Zhai; M.Baity-Jesi; E. Calore; A. Cruz; C.

In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex ({Delta}rnf) or just the MmcA subunit ({Delta}mmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the {Delta}mmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the {Delta}rnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.

ImportanceMethane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.20.500911,1.0,new results,2022-07-21 00:00:00,07/21/2022,,Blake E.

Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones.

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.","adaptive; cognitive flexibility; dopamine, sex differences, adolescent, reversal, adversity, mouse; feeding; food insecurity",,,,,2022-07-22 00:00:00,2022/07/20,2022/7/22,Wan Chen Lin; Christine Liu; Polina Kosillo; Lung-Hao Tai; Ezequiel Galarce; Helen S Bateup; Stephan Lammel; Linda Wilbrecht,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.

Yet, they can also act as a permissive niche for these pathogens to persist in infected tissues within granulomas, which are immunological structures comprised of macrophages and other immune cells. We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues. Thus ACE+ macrophages have differential capacity to serve as cellular niche for intracellular bacteria to establish persistent infection.

TeaserThis study shows that ACE+ granuloma macrophages have restricted capacity to act as a cellular niche that enables intracellular bacterial persistence.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.21.501041,1.0,new results,2022-07-22 00:00:00,07/22/2022,,Trung H.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

Commonly arising in sport, mounting evidence of varying degrees of cognitive impairment in retired athletes exposed to repeated concussions motivates close examination of its cumulative effects on the brain. Studying a cohort of 125 retired athletes with a mean of 11 reported concussions and 36 matched controls with none, here we evaluated whole-brain volumetric and subcortical morphological effects with Bayesian regression models and functional connectivity effects with network-based statistics. Estimates of potential cognitive impact were derived from meta-analytic functional mapping based on 13,459 imaging studies. Across the array of brain structural and functional effects identified, regions significantly lower in volume in the concussed group included, in order of greatest effect size, the middle frontal gyrus, hippocampus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors. These findings suggest that engagement in sport may benefit the brain across numerous domains, but also highlights the potentially damaging effects of concussive head injury.",,,medrxiv;2022.07.21.22277627,2.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-07-22 00:00:00,07/22/2022,,Michael Turner; Antonio Belli; Rudolph J.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, CT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7--corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap--then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the {Delta}Cs but not {Delta}Ch dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the {Delta}Cs{Delta}Ch community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the {Delta}Ch community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4-6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression.

We leverage multiple published datasets to show that Scriabin recovers expected CCC edges and use spatial transcriptomic data, genetic perturbation screens, and direct experimental manipulation of receptor-ligand interactions to validate that the recovered edges are biologically meaningful. We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of CCC from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here we present cytoself, a deep-learning approach for fully self-supervised protein localization profiling and clustering. Cytoself leverages a self-supervised training scheme that does not require preexisting knowledge, categories or annotations. Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches. Moreover, to better understand the inner workings of our model, we dissect the emergent features from which our clustering is derived, interpret them in the context of the fluorescence images, and analyze the performance contributions of each component of our approach.",,,,,,2022-07-26 00:00:00,2022/07/25,2022/7/26,Hirofumi Kobayashi; Keith C Cheveralls; Manuel D Leonetti; Loic A Royer,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hirofumi.kobayashi@czbiohub.org.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. loic.royer@czbiohub.org.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. manuel.leonetti@czbiohub.org.","Hirofumi Kobayashi: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. hirofumi.kobayashi@czbiohub.org.Keith C Cheveralls: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Manuel D Leonetti: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. manuel.leonetti@czbiohub.org.Loic A Royer: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. loic.royer@czbiohub.org.",,,10.1101/2021.03.29.437595,,,0

In excess, ROS lead to cytotoxic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ageing in animals and linked to age-related pathologies in humans. Acylamino acid-releasing enzymes (AARE) are bifunctional serine proteases, acting on oxidized proteins. AARE are found in all domains of life, albeit under different names, such as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH/ACPH), acylaminoacyl peptidase (AAP), or oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH). In humans, AARE malfunction is associated with age-related pathologies, while their function in plants is less clear. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of AARE genes in the plant lineage and an in-depth analysis of AARE localization and function in the moss Physcomitrella and the angiosperm Arabidopsis. AARE loss-of-function mutants have not been described for any organism so far. We generated and analysed such mutants and describe a connection between AARE function, aggregation of oxidized proteins and plant ageing, including accelerated developmental progression and reduced life span.

Using bioinformatics and chemoproteomics, we identify serine hydrolases in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that are specific to the Bacteroidetes phylum. Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling. Functional studies reveal that BT4193 is a true homolog of hDPP4 while the other is misannotated and is a proline-specific triaminopeptidase. We demonstrate that BT4193 is important for envelope integrity and is inhibited by FDA-approved type 2 diabetes drugs that target hDPP4. Loss of BT4193 reduces B. thetaiotaomicron fitness during in vitro growth within a diverse community.

In Escherichia coli, the Rcs system is required to survive A22 and mecillinam treatment, two drugs that perturb cell size. To test whether cell size changes might be correlated with envelope damage and thereby sensed by the Rcs system, we tuned E. coli cell size via drug inhibition with A22, point mutations to the cell-shape determinant MreB, and mechanically confined growth. In all conditions, cell width was strongly correlated with Rcs activation, with wider cells exhibiting more activation than wild-type. In all conditions, RcsF, the outer membrane-localized upstream component of the Rcs system, was essential for responding to cell width changes. Consistently, several envelope gene deletions known to induce the Rcs system via RcsF resulted in cells that were wider than wild-type. Cryo- electron microscopy revealed that the periplasm of a wide MreB mutant was on average [~]3 nm thinner than wild-type, thereby bringing RcsF closer to the downstream components of the signaling cascade in the inner membrane. Conversely, extending the flexible linker region of RcsF by [~]3 nm increased Rcs activity in wild-type cells.

Here we provide a single nucleus and single cell RNA-seq resource covering all of spermatogenesis in Drosophila starting from in-depth analysis of adult testis single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from the Fly Cell Atlas (FCA) study (Li et al., 2022). With over 44,000 nuclei and 6,000 cells analyzed, the data provide identification of rare cell types, mapping of intermediate steps in differentiation, and the potential to identify new factors impacting fertility or controlling differentiation of germline and supporting somatic cells. We justify assignment of key germline and somatic cell types using combinations of known markers, in situ hybridization, and analysis of extant protein traps. Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation. To complement the web-based portals for data analysis hosted by the FCA, we provide datasets compatible with commonly used software such as Seurat and Monocle.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.",actin tension; endoplasmic reticulum;

In response, cells mount complex responses across multiple scales, including adjusting their shape to withstand stress. In enterobacteria, the Rcs phosphorelay is activated by cell envelope damage and by changes to periplasmic dimensions and cell width. Here, we investigated the physiological and morphological consequences of Rcs activation in Escherichia coli in the absence of stresses, using an inducible version of RcsF that mislocalizes to the inner membrane, RcsFIM. Expression of RcsFIM immediately reduced cellular growth rate and the added length per cell cycle in a manner that was directly dependent on induction levels, but independent of Rcs-induced capsule production. At the same time, cells increased intracellular concentration of the cell division protein FtsZ, and decreased the distance between division rings in filamentous cells. Depletion of the Rcs negative regulator IgaA phenocopied RcsFIM induction, indicating that IgaA is essential due to growth inhibition in its absence. However, A22 treatment did not affect growth rate or FtsZ intracellular concentration, despite activating the Rcs system. These findings suggest that the effect of Rcs activation on FtsZ levels is mediated indirectly through growth-rate changes, and highlight feedbacks among the Rcs stress response, growth dynamics, and cell-size control.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.26.501648,1.0,new results,2022-07-27 00:00:00,07/27/2022,,Amanda Miguel; Matylda Zietek; Handuo Shi; Anna Sueki; Lisa Maier; Jolanda Verheul; Tanneke den Blaauwen; David Van Valen; Athanasios Typas; Kerwyn Casey Huang,"Miguel, A.; Zietek, M.; Shi, H.; Sueki, A.; Maier, L.; Verheul, J.; den Blaauwen, T.; Van Valen, D.

CRISPR screens have nominated gene targets for engineered T cells, but improved methods are required to compare large numbers of synthetic knockin sequences to reprogram cell functions. Here, we developed Modular Pooled Knockin Screening (ModPoKI), an adaptable platform for modular construction of DNA knockin libraries using barcoded multicistronic adaptors. We built two ModPoKI libraries of 100 transcription factors (TFs) and 129 natural and synthetic surface receptors. Over 20 ModPoKI screens across human TCR and CAR T cells in diverse conditions identified a transcription factor AP4 (TFAP4) construct to enhance long-term T cell fitness and anti-cancer function in vitro and in vivo. ModPoKIs modularity allowed us to generate a [~]10,000-member library of TF combinations. Non-viral knockin of a combined BATF-TFAP4 polycistronic construct further enhanced function in vivo.

In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear.

Recently, several papers have called into question the performance of lattice light sheets relative to the Gaussian sheets most common in light sheet microscopy. Here we undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of various forms of light sheet microscopy which both demonstrates and explains why lattice light sheets provide significant improvements in resolution and photobleaching reduction. The analysis provides a procedure to select the correct light sheet for a desired experiment and specifies the processing that maximizes the use of all fluorescence generated within the light sheet excitation envelope for optimal resolution while minimizing image artifacts and photodamage. Development of a new type of ""harmonic balanced"" lattice light sheet is shown to improve performance at all spatial frequencies within its 3D resolution limits and maintains this performance over lengthened propagation distances allowing for expanded fields of view.

Significance StatementDespite its rapidly growing use, several misconceptions remain concerning the physics of image formation and its optimization in light sheet microscopy, particularly in high resolution variants tailored for subcellular imaging. These include the role of excitation sidelobes, the significance of out-of-focus fluorescence, the importance and optimization of deconvolution, and the perceived advantages of Gaussian beams. Here we attempt to shatter these misconceptions by showing that the professed tradeoffs between axial resolution and background haze, photobleaching rate, phototoxicity, and propensity for image artifacts do not exist for well-crafted lattice light sheets whose data is acquired and processed rigorously. The framework we provide should enable others to optimize light sheets and extract the most information at the lowest cost in their experiments.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.30.502108,1.0,new results,2022-07-30 00:00:00,07/30/2022,,Gaoxiang Liu; Xiongtao Ruan; Daniel E.

Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.

ResultsVariation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.

ConclusionsThe observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.30.502150,1.0,new results,2022-08-02 00:00:00,08/02/2022,,Adam Officer; Andre M.

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-{kappa}B inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more I{kappa}B expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B that I{kappa}B usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable I{kappa}B mutant reduced NF-{kappa}B translocation and increased viral infection. These data demonstrate the functionality of ACE2-OE organoids in SARS-CoV-2 research and identify an incomplete NF-{kappa}B feedback loop as a rheostat of viral infection that may promote inflammation and severe disease.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.02.502100,1.0,new results,2022-08-02 00:00:00,08/02/2022,,Camille R.

We generated somatic-mutation profiles, identified copy-number alterations (CNAs), and compared results to non-Hispanic White (White) women in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Similar to Whites, PIK3CA and TP53 were the most commonly mutated genes in breast tumors from H/L. We found 4 common COSMIC mutation signatures (1, 2, 3, 13) and signature 16 not previously reported in other breast-cancer datasets. We observed recurrent amplifications in breast-cancer drivers including MYC, FGFR1, CCND1, and ERBB2, and a recurrent amplification on 17q11.2 associated with high KIAA0100 gene expression, implicated in breast-cancer aggressiveness.

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers. These intermediate EMP markers correlated with worse patient outcomes and could serve as potential new therapeutic targets to block metastatic development.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.04.502697,1.0,new results,2022-08-05 00:00:00,08/05/2022,,Juliane Winkler; Weilun Tan; Catherine M.

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-{kappa}B, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNF, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs. This study introduces a new robust tool for studying mammalian transcriptional regulation and demonstrates the power of optogenetic tools in dissecting the quantitative features of important cellular pathways.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.03.502739,1.0,new results,2022-08-05 00:00:00,08/05/2022,,Lindsey C.

Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy. In combination with signaling and simulation data, this study provides mechanistic insights into CB1 activation by different classes of ligands, and sheds light on the G protein preferences between endogenous and exogenous ligands.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.06.502185,1.0,new results,2022-08-07 00:00:00,08/07/2022,,Kaavya Krishna Kumar; Michael J.

To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.

Significance StatementDevelopment of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.04.502752,2.0,new results,2022-08-08 00:00:00,08/08/2022,,Will M.

Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products. Biosynthesis of THP and papaverine has not been achieved to date, in part because multiple pathway enzymes have not been elucidated. Here, we describe the development of an engineered yeast strain for de novo biosynthesis of THP.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene in Culex mosquitoes are associated with knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. RNAseq was used to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. The cDNA sequences were used to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F kdr mutation in the Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay was used successfully in six Culex spp. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. The L1014F kdr mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and was more prevalent in mosquitoes collected near farmland. The Culex RTkdr assay takes advantage of the RNA that vector control agencies routinely isolate to assess arbovirus prevalence in mosquitoes. We anticipate that public health and vector control agencies may employ the Culex RTkdr assay to define the geographic distribution of the L1014F kdr mutation in Culex species and improve the monitoring of insecticide resistance that will ultimately contribute to effective control of Culex mosquitoes.",,,,,,2022-08-09 00:00:00,2022/08/08,2022/8/9,Kelli M Hager; Erick Gaona; Amy Kistler; Kalani Ratnasiri; Hanna Retallack; Miguel Barretto; Sarah S Wheeler; Christopher M Hoover; Eric J Haas-Stapleton,,"Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.; Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.; Sacramento-Yolo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, CA, United States of America.; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.; University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.","Kelli M Hager: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.Erick Gaona: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.Amy Kistler: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.Kalani Ratnasiri: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.Hanna Retallack: University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.Miguel Barretto: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.Sarah S Wheeler: Sacramento-Yolo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, CA, United States of America.Christopher M Hoover: School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.Eric J Haas-Stapleton: Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.",,,,,,0

Despite its ubiquity, the complexity of designing and controlling custom microfluidic devices present major barriers to adoption, requiring intuitive knowledge gained from years of experience. If these barriers were overcome, microfluidics could miniaturize biological and chemical research for non-experts through fully-automated platform development and operation.

Current treatment strategies focus on mTOR inhibition with rapamycin and its derivatives. While effective at improving some aspects of TSC, chronic rapamycin inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and is associated with systemic side-effects. It is currently unknown which mTOR complex is most relevant for TSC-related brain phenotypes. Here we used genetic strategies to selectively reduce neuronal mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity in mouse models of TSC. We find that reduction of the mTORC1 component Raptor, but not the mTORC2 component Rictor, rebalanced mTOR signaling in Tsc1 knock-out neurons.

Here we determine cryo-EM structures of our receptor traps in complex with full length Spike. We develop a multi-model pipeline combining Rosetta protein modeling software and cryo-EM to allow interface energy calculations even at limited resolution and identify interface side chains that allow for high affinity interactions between our ACE2 receptor traps and Spike-RBD. Our structural analysis provides a mechanistic rationale for the high affinity (0.53 - 4.2nM) binding of our ACE2 receptor traps to Omicron-RBD confirmed with biolayer interferometry measurements.

Here, we present an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER). We show that SIMMER predicts the chemistry and responsible species and enzymes for a queried reaction with high accuracy, unlike previous methods. We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug transformations known to occur in the human gut. Bacterial species containing these enzymes are enriched within human donor stool samples that metabolize the query compound. After demonstrating its utility and accuracy, we chose to make SIMMER available as both a command-line and web tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical transformations within the human gut.

Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts.

Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies.

We show in a series of examples that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches for inferring RNA velocity with improvements in fit to the data, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells, and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that properties unique to veloVI, such as posterior velocity uncertainty, can be used to assess the appropriateness of analysis with velocity to the data at hand.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",,,,,,2022-08-16 00:00:00,2022/08/15,2022/8/16,Takayoshi Shirasaki;

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS. These results open up exciting new avenues for improving picoscale droplet RT-PCR reactions and expanding microfluidic droplet based single-cell analysis technologies.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.16.504154,1.0,new results,2022-08-17 00:00:00,08/17/2022,,Margarita Khariton; Conor J.

Despite this, we currently lack a predictive understanding of how leaf-associated bacterial communities are structured within and across hosts, including how leaf traits shape this variation and how community assembly processes may differ across distinct microbial habitats on a leaf. In this study, we characterize the composition of bacterial phyllosphere communities from the upper and lower leaf surfaces of 66 plants across 24 species grown at a common site using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing leaves that vary in pH and stomatal densities and analyzing the leaf surfaces separately, we were able to test the key factors shaping the phyllosphere across host plant species from diverse geographical origins. We found a surprisingly large shared/core microbiome across species, as well as a strong effect of plant species and native origin in shaping composition. Importantly, we found the lower leaf side, where pH values are generally lower and stomatal densities higher, to have lower taxonomic richness relative to the upper leaf side. While the upper leaf side community appears to be more strongly influenced by dispersal effects, the lower leaf appears to be more strongly influenced by plant host filtering effects, as supported by higher relative abundance of shared core taxa and higher signatures of endemism. This work highlights important differences in community assembly processes across the upper and lower leaf microbiomes and underscores the importance of considering differences among habitats within a host when explaining microbial community assembly and composition.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.16.504148,1.0,new results,2022-08-17 00:00:00,08/17/2022,,Wenke Smets; Mason K Chock; Corinne M Walsh; Caihong Qiu Vanderburgh; Ethan Kau; Steve E Lindow; Noah Fierer; Britt Koskella,"Smets, W.; Chock, M.

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.

MethodsWe collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.

ResultsAmong 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples. Among 1,321 RT-PCR positive samples, 938/1321 (71%) were detected by BinaxNOW; 95% (774/817) of those with Ct value <30 were detected by BinaxNOW. BinaxNOW detection was consistent over lineages. In analyses to evaluate entry to treatment, BinaxNOW detected 82.7% (410/496, 95% CI: 79-86%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In comparison, RT-PCR (24-hour turnaround) detected 83.1% (412/496 95% CI: 79-86%) and RT-PCR (48-hour turnaround) detected 66.3% (329/496 95% CI: 62-70%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW detected high viral load from anterior nasal swabs consistently across omicron sublineages emerging between January and June of 2022. Simulations support BinaxNOW as an entry point for COVID-19 treatment in a community field setting.",,,medrxiv;2022.08.17.22278913,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-08-18 00:00:00,08/18/2022,,John Schrom; Carina Marquez; Chung-Yu Wang; Aditi Saxena; Anthea M.

While many studies have focused on tick-borne bacteria, far less is known about tick-associated viruses and their roles in public health or tick physiology. To address this, we investigated patterns of bacterial and viral communities across two field populations of western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 100 individual ticks, we quantified taxon prevalence, abundance, and co-occurrence with other members of the tick microbiome. Our analysis revealed 11 novel RNA viruses from Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Picornaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Reoviridae, Solemovidiae, Narnaviridae, and 2 highly divergent RNA viruses lacking sequence similarity to known viral families. The majority of these viruses were also detectable in lab-raised ticks at all developmental life stages, localize to tick salivary glands, and show evidence of circulation in mice fed on by ticks. These data suggest that viruses are stable, heritable, and transmissible members of the tick microbiota. We also unexpectedly identified numerous virus-like transcripts that are associated with tick genomic DNA, most of which are distinct from known endogenous viral element-mediated immunity pathways in invertebrates. Together, our work reveals that in addition to potentially serving as vectors for potential viral pathogens, I. pacificus ticks may also have symbiotic partnerships with their own vertically-transmitted viruses or with ancient viruses through evolutionarily acquired virus-like transcripts. Our findings highlight how pervasive and intimate tick-virus interactions are, with major implications for both the fundamental physiology and vector biology of I. pacificus ticks.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.17.504163,1.0,new results,2022-08-18 00:00:00,08/18/2022,,Calla Martyn; Beth M.

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection. These data demonstrate the functionality of ACE2-OE organoids in SARS-CoV-2 research and identify an incomplete NF-κB feedback loop as a rheostat of viral infection that may promote inflammation and severe disease.",,,,,,2022-08-20 00:00:00,2022/08/02,2022/8/20,Camille R Simoneau;

As such, there is a strong need to establish a characterization system to support the reproducibility of nanoscience data particularly for studies seeking clinical translation.

The mass of our planet setting a constant gravitational pull and its daily rotation on its axis setting a circadian rhythm are two examples of universal ecological parameters that shape the physiology of every living creature on earth. In the ocean, gravity plays a critical role in shaping the life history of phytoplankton with vast diversity of size and cell geometries all depending on light to survive while gravity is pulling them down. In order to survive, these organisms must evolve means to navigate a vertically stratified ocean. Here we present how cellular topology can enable sinking, rising, and levitation dynamics of seemingly non-motile cells in the open ocean. By studying the bio-luminescent dinoflagellate Pyrocystis noctiluca, we discover how rapid inflation dynamics regulates cell size and buoyancy in coordination to its cell cycle. Live-cell light-sheet imaging reveals a (n-genus) toroidal cytoplasm that enables this rapid inflation of overall cell volume over 5 fold in 15 minutes without dilution of cytoplasmic contents. Here we present combined field and lab measurements with system modeling to build a general framework for how non-motile plankton can escape the gravitational sedimentation trap, and how precise control of cell size becomes essential to survival.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",DNA damage; SA-beta-Gal; cell cycle; cell size; p16(INK4); palbociclib; polyploidy; proteomics; senescence; size-scaling,,,,,2022-08-21 00:00:00,2022/08/19,2022/8/21,Michael C Lanz; Evgeny Zatulovskiy; Matthew P Swaffer; Lichao Zhang; Ilayda Ilerten; Shuyuan Zhang; Dong Shin You; Georgi Marinov; Patrick McAlpine; Joshua E Elias; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

While individual pathways have been well-studied, we have lacked a comprehensive understanding of what receptor combinations are expressed and how they are distributed across cell types. Here, combining data from multiple single-cell gene expression atlases, we analyzed the expression profiles of core signaling pathways, including TGF-{beta}, Notch, Wnt, and Eph-ephrin, as well as non-signaling pathways. In many pathways, a limited set of receptor expression profiles are used recurrently in many distinct cell types. While some recurrent profiles are restricted to groups of closely related cells, others, which we term pathway expression motifs, reappear in distantly related cell types spanning diverse tissues and organs. Motif usage was generally uncorrelated between pathways, remained stable in a given cell type during aging, but could change in sudden punctuated transitions during development.

We apply this model to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by fitting just one global parameter representing the frequency of interaction between individuals. We find that the predicted infections agree reasonably well with the reported cases. We clearly see the effect of ""shelter-in-place"" policies introduced at the onset of the pandemic. Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel. We find that this policy is successful in decreasing the epidemic size and slowing down the spread, but less effective than the shelter-in-place policy. This policy can result in a pulled wave of infections. We express its velocity and characterize the shape of the traveling front as a function of the epidemiological parameters.

How animals without neurons process information and respond to environmental cues promises a new window into studying precursors of neuronal control and origin of the nervous system as we know it today. Robust decision making in animals, such as in chemotaxis or thermotaxis, often requires internal symmetry breaking (such as A-P axis) provided naturally by a given body plan of an animal. Here we report the discovery of robust thermotaxis behavior in Trichoplax adhaerens, an early-divergent, enigmatic animal with no anterior-posterior symmetry breaking (apolar), and no known neurons or muscles. We present the first quantitative and robust behavioral response assay in placozoan, which present an apolar flat geometry. By exposing T. adhaerens to a thermal gradient under a long-term imaging setup, we observe robust thermotaxis that occurs over timescale of hours, independent of any circadian rhythms. We quantify that T. adhaerens can detect thermal gradients of at least 0.1 {degrees}C/cm. Positive thermotaxis is observed for a range of baseline temperatures from 17-22.5 {degrees}C with motility trajectories to be well-described by a Levy distribution. Interestingly, the organism does not maintain a fixed orientation while performing thermotaxis. Utilizing natural diversity in size of adult organisms (100um to a few mm), we also demonstrate a critical animal size above which thermotaxis behavior is hindered. Several TRP family homologs have been previously reported to be conserved in metazoans, including in T. adhaerens. We discover naringenin, a known TRPM3 antagonist, inhibits thermotaxis in T. adhaerens. The discovery of robust thermotaxis in T. adhaerens provides a tractable handle to interrogate information processing in a brainless animal.

To resolve causal variants, meta-analysis studies typically apply summary statistics-based fine-mapping methods as they are applied to single-cohort studies. However, it is unclear whether heterogeneous characteristics of each cohort (e.g., ancestry, sample size, phenotyping, genotyping, or imputation) affect fine-mapping calibration and recall. Here, we first demonstrate that meta-analysis fine-mapping is substantially miscalibrated in simulations when different genotyping arrays or imputation panels are included. To mitigate these issues, we propose a summary statistics-based QC method, SLALOM, that identifies suspicious loci for meta-analysis fine-mapping by detecting outliers in association statistics based on ancestry-matched local LD structure. Having validated SLALOM performance in simulations and the GWAS Catalog, we applied it to 14 disease endpoints from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative and found that 67% of loci showed suspicious patterns that call into question fine-mapping accuracy. These predicted suspicious loci were significantly depleted for having likely causal variants, such as nonsynonymous variants, as a lead variant (2.7x; Fishers exact P = 7.3 x 10-4). Compared to fine-mapping results in individual biobanks, we found limited evidence of fine-mapping improvement in the GBMI meta-analyses.

To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, whereas others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each individual mutant in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, whereas others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with the same resistance gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with different resistance genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others.

To date, underlying molecular mechanisms of PSC remain unclear and therapeutic options for PSC patients are limited. We performed cell-free messenger RNA (cf-mRNA) next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the circulating transcriptome of PSC and non-invasively investigate potentially bioactive signals that are associated with PSC.

METHODSSerum cf-mRNA profiles were compared among 50 individuals with PSC, 20 healthy controls, and 235 individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Tissue and cell type-of-origin genes that are dysregulated in subjects with PSC were evaluated. Subsequently, diagnostic classifiers were built using PSC dysregulated cf-mRNA genes.

RESULTSDifferential expression analysis of the cf-mRNA transcriptomes of PSC and healthy controls resulted in identification of 1407 dysregulated genes. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes between PSC and the liver diseases (NAFL and Non-Alcohol Steatohepatitis (NASH)) or healthy controls shared common genes known to be involved in liver pathophysiology. In particular, genes from liver- and specific cell type-origin, including hepatocyte, hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells, were highly abundant in cf-mRNA of subjects with PSC. Gene cluster analysis revealed that liver-specific genes dysregulated in PSC form a distinct cluster which corresponded to a subset of the PSC subject population. Finally, we developed a cf-mRNA classifier using liver-specific genes which discriminated PSC from healthy control subjects using gene transcripts of liver origin.

CONCLUSIONSBlood-based whole transcriptome cf-mRNA profiling revealed high abundance of liver-specific genes in PSC subject sera which may be used to diagnose PSC patients. We identified several unique cf-mRNA profiles of subjects with PSC. These findings may also have utility for non-invasive molecular stratification of subjects with PSC for pharmacotherapy safety and response studies.

However, nearly all of these antibodies have been rendered obsolete by SARS-CoV-2 variants that evolved to resist similar, naturally occurring antibodies. Here, we describe the development of human monoclonal antibodies that bind the ACE2 receptor rather than the viral spike protein. These antibodies block infection by all ACE2 binding sarbecoviruses, including emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that the antibodies target an ACE2 epitope that engages SARS-CoV-2 spike. Importantly, the antibodies do not inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity, nor do they induce ACE depletion from cell surfaces. The antibodies exhibit favorable pharmacology and protect human ACE2 knock-in mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such antibodies should be useful prophylactic and treatment agents against any current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as ACE2-binding sarbecoviruses that might emerge as future pandemic threats.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.24.505169,1.0,new results,2022-08-24 00:00:00,08/24/2022,,Fengwen Zhang; Jesse Jenkins; Renan V.H. de Carvalho; Sandra Nakandakari-Higa; Teresia Chen; Morgan E.

However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maasts utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maast is a fast, reliable SNP genotyping tool that empowers population genetic meta-analysis of microbes at an unrivaled scale.

Studies of hepatoblastoma that focus exclusively on tumor cells demonstrate sparse somatic mutations and a common cell of origin, the hepatoblast, across patients. In contrast to the homogeneity these studies would suggest, hepatoblastoma tumors have a high degree of heterogeneity that can portend poor prognosis. In this study, we use single-cell transcriptomic techniques to analyze resected human pediatric hepatoblastoma specimens, and identify five hepatoblastoma tumor signatures that may account for the tumor heterogeneity observed in this disease. Notably, patient-derived hepatoblastoma spheroid cultures predict differential responses to treatment based on the transcriptomic signature of each tumor, suggesting a path forward for precision oncology for these tumors.

Effector domains within these proteins can activate or repress transcription. However, for many of these regulators we do not know what type of transcriptional effector domains they contain, their location in the protein, their activation and repression strengths, and the amino acids that are necessary for their functions. Here, we systematically measure the transcriptional effector activity of >100,000 protein fragments (each 80 amino acids long) tiling across most chromatin regulators and transcription factors in human cells (2,047 proteins). By testing the effect they have when recruited at reporter genes, we annotate 307 new activation domains and 592 new repression domains, a [~]5-fold increase over the number of previously annotated effectors3,4. Complementary rational mutagenesis and deletion scans across all the effector domains reveal aromatic and/or leucine residues interspersed with acidic, proline, serine, and/or glutamine residues are necessary for activation domain activity. Additionally, the majority of repression domain sequences contain either sites for SUMOylation, short interaction motifs for recruiting co-repressors, or are structured binding domains for recruiting other repressive proteins. Surprisingly, we discover bifunctional domains that can both activate and repress and can dynamically split a cell population into high- and low-expression subpopulations. Our systematic annotation and characterization of transcriptional effector domains provides a rich resource for understanding the function of human transcription factors and chromatin regulators, engineering compact tools for controlling gene expression, and refining predictive computational models of effector domain function.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.26.505496,1.0,new results,2022-08-26 00:00:00,08/26/2022,,Nicole DelRosso; Josh Tycko; Peter Suzuki; Cecelia Andrews; Aradhana; Adi Mukund; Ivan Liongson; Connor Ludwig; Kaitlyn Spees; Polly Fordyce; Michael C.

Previous studies have shown that the human gut is a hot spot for gene transfer between species, but the more subtle exchange of variation within species - collectively known as recombination - remains poorly characterized in this ecosystem. Here, we show that the genetic structure of the human gut microbiome provides unique opportunities to measure individual recombination events directly, enabling quantitative comparisons of recombination across a diverse range of species that inhabit a common environment. By analyzing a large collection of recent recombination events in the core genomes of 29 gut commensals, we uncovered systematic heterogeneities in the rates and lengths of transferred segments, which are difficult to explain by existing models of ecological isolation or reduced efficiencies of recombination. We also find that natural selection plays a role in facilitating the spread of genetic variants onto different strain backgrounds, both within individual hosts and across the broader global population. These results shed light on the dynamics of in situ recombination, which place important constraints on the adaptability of gut microbial communities.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.24.505183,1.0,new results,2022-08-26 00:00:00,08/26/2022,,Zhiru Liu; Benjamin H Good,"Liu, Z.; Good, B.

Recently, deep-learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in classifying variants as pathogenic or benign. However, these models are currently unable to provide predictions over all missense variants, either because of dependency on close protein homologs or due to software limitations. Here we leveraged ESM1b, a 650M-parameter protein language model, to predict the functional impact of human coding variation at scale. To overcome existing technical limitations, we developed a modified ESM1b workflow and functionalized, for the first time, all proteins in the human genome, resulting in predictions for all [~]450M possible missense variant effects. ESM1b was able to distinguish between pathogenic and benign variants across [~]150K variants annotated in ClinVar and HGMD, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. ESM1b also exceeded the state of the art at predicting the experimental results of deep mutational scans. We further annotated [~]2M variants across [~]9K alternatively-spliced genes as damaging in certain protein isoforms while neutral in others, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms when functionalizing variant effects.

Applying TACIT for motor cortex and parvalbumin-positive interneurons to neurological phenotypes revealed dozens of new OCR-phenotype associations. Many associated OCRs were near relevant genes, including brain size-associated OCRs near genes mutated in microcephaly or macrocephaly.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue composition within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

To better understand the role of long-range interactions between distal regulatory elements during the early transformation from healthy colon to colorectal cancer, here we performed high resolution chromatin conformation capture for 33 samples including non-neoplastic mucosa, adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinomas, mostly from Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients. We identified hundreds of thousands of chromatin micro-structures, such as architectural stripes and loops, which originated from active cis-regulatory elements. Surprisingly, these structures progressively decayed throughout cancer progression, particularly at promoters. Meta-analyses revealed that this decay was independent of alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. Interestingly, the degree of interaction loss was poorly correlated with gene expression changes. Instead, genes whose expression were disproportionately lower and higher than their relative promoter interaction in mucosa shifted their expression in polyps and adenocarcinomas to yield a more direct relationship between strength of interaction and gene expression.

Invariably, at least one member of the perilipin family of proteins (PLIN1-5) associates with LDs in all cell types. Despite key roles of PLIN2 in governing hepatic lipid metabolism, the mechanisms that regulate PLIN2 levels remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a set of genome-edited PLIN2 reporter cell lines that facilitate the analysis of genes that regulate PLIN2 and LD abundance. Leveraging these reporter cells in a series of CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens, we generate a comprehensive inventory of genes that influence PLIN2 levels under different metabolic conditions. Moreover, we uncouple their effects on PLIN2 expression and post-translational stability. Identified genetic modifiers include canonical genes that control LD metabolism (e.g., ACSL3, DGAT2, PNPLA2, ABHD5) as well as genes with less characterized roles in PLIN2 and LD regulation such as ubiquitination machinery (e.g., MARCH6, UBE2J2), transcription regulators (e.g., HNF4A, HDAC3), mitochondrial pathways (e.g., electron transport chain and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis), and others. These CRISPR screens, and several published screens that focus on different aspects of lipid metabolism, provide the foundation for CRISPRlipid (http://crisprlipid.org), a versatile, online data commons for lipid-related functional genomics data.

Between 2017-2019 an all-age cohort from Tororo, eastern Uganda was followed by continuous passive and routine assessments. Among 104 longitudinally monitored incident infections coming from 98 individuals, we observed that nearly all infections lasting 3 or more months initiated gametocyte production prior to clearance. However, the majority of infections were of shorter duration (<28 days) and were cleared before gametocytes were detectable.

Yet the microbial functions that underpin this succession are not well described. Further, its unclear how previous precipitation frames microbial capacities after rewetting and how long these effects persist. We used isotopically-labeled water to rewet seasonally dry annual grassland soil that experienced either mean annual or reduced precipitation during the previous two years, and sampled at five subsequent time points. We used quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP)-informed genome- resolved metagenomics to identify growing microorganisms, predict their capabilities, and analyze how these traits differed over time and between precipitation treatments. Organisms that grew after wetup were more abundant than non-growing organisms prior to the wet-up, suggesting that traits that initiate succession are pre-defined at the end of the prior plant growing season or via survival over the summer. Fast-growing organisms had fewer carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) genes per genome than slower-growing organisms, suggesting that although fast-growers were capable of degrading complex C, they may not specialize in this process. Differential abundance of CAZy genes in growing organisms throughout the succession implies that substrate availability varied with time. In contrast, the abundance of peptidases in growing organisms differed between precipitation treatments, but not over time following wet-up. Before wet-up, the soil organisms gene inventories were different between the two precipitation treatments. Surprisingly, this legacy effect waned after just one week.

The glucagon receptor (GCGR), a Family B GPCR responsible for maintenance of proper blood sugar levels, interacts with RAMP2, though the purpose and consequence of this interaction is poorly understood. Using a series of biochemical and cell-based assays, we show that RAMP2 interacts with and broadly inhibits GCGR-induced downstream signaling. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) demonstrates that RAMP2 enhances local flexibility in select locations in and near the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) as well as at a key region in the 6th transmembrane helix, while single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments show that this RAMP2-induced ECD disorder results in inhibition of active and intermediate states of the intracellular face of the receptor. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), we determined the structure of the GCGR-Gs complex at 2.9 [A] resolution in the presence of RAMP2. RAMP2 apparently does not interact with GCGR in an ordered manner, yet the ECD of GCGR is indeed largely disordered in the presence of RAMP2. This disorder is accompanied by rearrangements of several key areas of the receptor, resulting in the formation of a likely unproductive complex.

It is thought to be a key contributing factor to childhood malnutrition, growth stunting, and diminished oral vaccine responses. Although EE has been shown to be the by-product of a recurrent enteric infection, its full pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, we mapped the cellular and molecular correlates of EE by performing high-throughput, single-cell RNA-sequencing on 33 small intestinal biopsies from 11 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia (eight HIV-negative and three HIV-positive), six adults without EE in Boston, United States, and two adults in Durban, South Africa, which we complemented with published data from three additional individuals from the same clinical site. We analyzed previously defined bulk-transcriptomic signatures of reduced villus height and decreased microbial translocation in EE and showed that these signatures may be driven by an increased abundance of surface mucosal cells-a gastric-like subset previously implicated in epithelial repair in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, we determined cell subsets whose fractional abundances associate with EE severity, small intestinal region, and HIV infection. Furthermore, by comparing duodenal EE samples with those from three control cohorts, we identified dysregulated WNT and MAPK signaling in the EE epithelium and increased proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in a T cell subset highly expressing a transcriptional signature of tissue-resident memory cells in the EE cohort. Together, our work elucidates epithelial and immune correlates of EE and nominates cellular and molecular targets for intervention.",,,,,,2022-09-01 00:00:00,2022/08/31,2022/9/1,Conner Kummerlowe; Simutanyi Mwakamui;

Normally asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune dysfunction, and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth are not defined. Here, we show that control of mite HF colonization in mice required group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), interleukin-13 (IL-13), and its receptor, IL-4Ra-IL-13Ra1. HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice. Our studies uncover a key role for skin ILC2s and IL-13, which comprise an immune checkpoint that sustains cutaneous integrity and restricts pathologic infestation by colonizing HF mites.",Demodex mites; IL-13; ILC2; barrier function; hair follicle stem cell; innate immunity; rhinophyma; skin homeostasis; tissue immunity; type 2 immunity,,,,,2022-09-01 00:00:00,2022/08/30,2022/9/1,Roberto R Ricardo-Gonzalez; Maya E Kotas; Claire E O'Leary; Katelyn Singh; William Damsky; Chang Liao; Elizabeth Arouge; Iliana Tenvooren; Diana M Marquez; Andrew W Schroeder; Jarish N Cohen; Marlys S Fassett; Jinwoo Lee; Scott G Daniel; Kyle Bittinger; Roberto Efraín Díaz; James S Fraser; Niwa Ali; K Mark Ansel; Matthew H Spitzer; Hong-Erh Liang; Richard M Locksley,,"Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Tetrad Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces an intrinsically different data type than scRNA-seq and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas as well as from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results. We conclude that compared to scRNA-seq, MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for measuring single-cell gene expression and can robustly identify cell types without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq reference atlases.",,,biorxiv;2022.03.04.483068,3.0,new results,2022-09-01 00:00:00,09/01/2022,,Jonathan Liu; Vanessa Tran; Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri; Ashley Byrne; Michael Borja; Yang Joon Kim; Snigdha Agarwal; Ruofan Wang; Kyle Awayan; Abhishek Murti; Aris Taychameekiatchai; Bruce Wang; George Emanuel; Jiang He; John Haliburton; Angela Oliveira Pisco; Norma Neff,"Liu, J.; Tran, V.; Vemuri, V.

With an aim of further understanding sex chromosome turnover, we investigated the polymorphic sex chromosomes of the Marsabit clawed frog, Xenopus borealis, using genomic data and a new chromosome-scale genome assembly. We confirmed previous findings that 54.1 Mb of chromosome 8L is sex-linked in animals from east Kenya and a laboratory strain, but most (or all) of this region is not sex-linked in natural populations from west Kenya. Previous work suggests possible degeneration of the Z chromosomes in the east population because many sex-linked transcripts of this female heterogametic population have female-biased expression, and we therefore expected this chromosome to not be present in the west population. In contrast, our simulations support a model where most or all of the sex-linked portion of the Z chromosome from the east acquired autosomal segregation in the west, and where much genetic variation specific to the large sex-linked portion of the W chromosome from the east is not present in the west. These recent changes are consistent with the hot-potato model, wherein sex chromosome turnover is favoured by natural selection if it purges a (minimally) degenerate sex-specific sex chromosome, but counterintuitively suggest natural selection failed to purge a Z chromosome that has signs of more advanced and possibly more ancient regulatory degeneration. These findings highlight complex evolutionary dynamics of young, rapidly evolving Xenopus sex chromosomes and set the stage for mechanistic work aimed at pinpointing additional sex-determining genes in this group.",amphibians; rapid evolution; recombination suppression; sex chromosome turnover,,,,,2022-09-03 00:00:00,2022/08/24,2022/9/3,Ben J Evans; Austin B Mudd; Jessen V Bredeson; Benjamin L S Furman; Domnick Victor Wasonga; Jessica B Lyons; Richard M Harland; Dan S Rokhsar,,"Biology Department, Life Sciences Building Room 328, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.; Biology Department, Life Sciences Building Room 328, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.; Canexia Health, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna, Japan.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, California, USA.; National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.","Ben J Evans: Biology Department, Life Sciences Building Room 328, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Austin B Mudd: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.Jessen V Bredeson: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.Benjamin L S Furman: Biology Department, Life Sciences Building Room 328, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.; Canexia Health, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.Domnick Victor Wasonga: National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.Jessica B Lyons: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.Richard M Harland: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.Dan S Rokhsar: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna, Japan.; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, California, USA.",,,,,,0

We hypothesized that metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), which allows for broad genomic-level detection of infectious agents in a biological sample, can systematically identify potential causes of non-malarial fevers.

Methods and FindingsThe 212 participants in this study were of all ages and were enrolled in a longitudinal malaria cohort in eastern Uganda. Between December 2020 and August 2021, respiratory swabs and plasma samples were collected at 313 study visits where participants presented with fever and were negative for malaria by microscopy. Samples were analyzed using CZ ID, a web-based platform for microbial detection in mNGS data. Overall, viral pathogens were detected at 123 of 313 visits (39%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected at 11 visits, from which full viral genomes were recovered from nine. Other prevalent viruses included Influenza A (14 visits), RSV (12 visits), and three of the four strains of seasonal coronaviruses (6 visits). Notably, 11 influenza cases occurred between May and July 2021, coinciding with when the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in this population. The primary limitation of this study is that we were unable to estimate the contribution of bacterial microbes to non-malarial fevers, due to the difficulty of distinguishing bacterial microbes that were pathogenic from those that were commensal or contaminants.

ConclusionsThese results revealed the co-circulation of multiple viral pathogens likely associated with fever in the cohort during this time period. This study illustrates the utility of mNGS in elucidating the multiple causes of non-malarial febrile illness. A better understanding of the pathogen landscape in different settings and age groups could aid in informing diagnostics, case management, and public health surveillance systems.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.02.22279519,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-09-04 00:00:00,09/04/2022,,Lusajo Mwakibete; Saki Takahashi; Vida Ahyong; Allison Black; John Rek; Isaac Ssewanyana; Moses Kamya; Grant Dorsey; Prasanna Jagannathan; Isabel Rodríguez-Barraquer; Cristina M.

Here, we build on classical ecological models of resource competition to investigate community responses to antibiotic-induced species-specific death rates. Our analyses highlight the complex dependence of species coexistence that can arise from the interplay of resource competition and antibiotic activity, independent of other biological mechanisms. We show that resource competition can cause richness to change non-monotonically as antibiotic concentrations are increased. We identified resource competition structures that cause richness to depend on the order of sequential application of antibiotics (non-transitivity), and the emergence of synergistic and antagonistic effects under simultaneous application of multiple antibiotics (non-additivity). These complex behaviors can be prevalent, especially when generalist consumers are targeted. Communities can be prone to either synergism or antagonism, but typically not both, and antagonism is more common. Furthermore, we identify a striking overlap in competition structures that lead to non-transitivity during antibiotic sequences and those that lead to non-additivity during antibiotic combination, suggesting that our analysis is broadly applicable across a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotic treatment schemes.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been associated with abnormal cortical interneuron development, but which of the hundreds of NDD genes impact interneuron generation and migration into circuits and how they mediate these effects remain unknown. We previously developed a stem cell-based platform to study human cortical interneurons in self-organizing organoids resembling the ventral forebrain and their migration using forebrain assembloids. Here, we integrate assembloid technology with CRISPR screening to systematically investigate the involvement of 425 NDD genes in human interneuron development. The first screen aimed at interneuron generation revealed 13 candidate genes, including the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 and the canonical TGF{beta} signaling activator SMAD4. Then, we ran an interneuron migration screen in [~]1,000 forebrain assembloids that identified 33 candidate genes, including cytoskeleton-related genes and, notably, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related gene LNPK. Interestingly, we discovered that, during interneuron migration, the ER is displaced along the leading neuronal branch prior to nuclear translocation. Deletion of LNPK interfered with this ER displacement and resulted in reduced interneuron saltation length, indicating a critical role for the ER in this migratory process. Taken together, these results highlight how this versatile CRISPR-assembloid platform can be used to systematically map disease genes onto early stages of human neural development and to reveal novel mechanisms regulating interneuron development.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.06.506845,1.0,new results,2022-09-06 00:00:00,09/06/2022,,Xiangling Meng; David Yao; Xiaoyu Chen; Kevin W.

Traditional approaches use regression to sequentially test multiplicative interaction terms involving single pairs of genetic variants. For higher-order interactions and genome-wide large-scale data, this strategy is computationally intractable. Moreover, multiplicative terms used in regression modeling may not capture the form of biological interactions. Building on the Predictability, Computability, Stability (PCS) framework, we introduce the epiTree pipeline to extract higher-order interactions from genomic data using tree-based models. The epiTree pipeline first selects a set of variants derived from tissue-specific estimates of gene expression. Next, it uses iterative random forests (iRF) to search training data for candidate Boolean interactions (pairwise and higher-order). We derive significance tests from interactions by simulating Boolean tree-structured null (no epistasis) and alternative (epistasis) distributions on hold-out test data. Finally, our pipeline computes PCS epistasis p-values that evaluate the stability of improvement in prediction accuracy via bootstrap sampling on the test set. We validate the epiTree pipeline using the phenotype of red-hair from the UK Biobank, where several genes are known to demonstrate epistatic interactions. epiTree recovers both previously reported and novel interactions, which represent forms of non-linearities not captured by logistic regression models. Additionally, epiTree suggests interactions between genes such as PKHD1 and XPOTP1, which are unlinked to MC1R, as novel candidate interactions associated with the red hair phenotype. Last but not least, we find that individual Boolean or tree-based epistasis models generally provide higher prediction accuracy than classical logistic regression.",,,biorxiv;2020.11.24.396846,2.0,new results,2022-09-07 00:00:00,09/07/2022,,Merle Behr; Karl Kumbier; Aldo Cordova-Palomera; Matthew Aguirre; Euan Ashley; Atul J.

PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.",disease models; genetics; genome engineering; genomics; hPSCs; human; parkinson's disease; prime editing; regenerative medicine; stem cells,,,,,2022-09-08 00:00:00,2022/09/07,2022/9/8,Hanqin Li; Oriol Busquets; Yogendra Verma; Khaja Mohieddin Syed; Nitzan Kutnowski; Gabriella R Pangilinan; Luke A Gilbert; Helen S Bateup; Donald C Rio; Dirk Hockemeyer; Frank Soldner,,"Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network, Chevy Chase, United States.; Dominick P.

It is now possible to quantitatively measure the enhancer activity of thousands of HARs in parallel and model how each nucleotide contributes to gene expression. These strategies have revealed that many human HAR sequences function differently than their chimpanzee orthologs, though individual nucleotide changes in the same HAR may have opposite effects, consistent with compensatory substitutions.

Here, we created a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain NCIB 3610 and investigated growth, biofilm colony wrinkling, and sporulation phenotypes of the knockdown library. First, we showed that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. Second, we quantified biofilm colony wrinkling using a custom image analysis algorithm and found that fatty acid synthesis and DNA gyrase knockdown strains exhibited increased wrinkling independent of biofilm matrix gene expression. Third, we designed a high-throughput screen to quantify sporulation efficiency after essential gene knockdown; we found that partial knockdowns of essential genes remained competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but knockdown of essential genes involved in fatty acid synthesis exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation.

We present TOGA, the first method that integrates gene annotation and orthology inference. TOGA implements a novel paradigm to infer orthologous genes, improves ortholog detection and annotation completeness compared to state-of-the-art methods, and handles even highly-fragmented assemblies. TOGA scales to hundreds of genomes, which we demonstrate by applying it to 488 placental mammal and 308 bird assemblies, creating the largest comparative gene resources so far. Additionally, TOGA detects gene losses, enables selection screens, and automatically provides a superior measure of mammalian genome quality. Together, TOGA is a powerful and scalable method to annotate and compare genes in the genomic era.

Nsp14 forms a stable complex with non-structural protein Nsp10 and exhibits exoribonuclease and N7-methyltransferase activities. Protein-interactome studies identified human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a putative binding partner of Nsp14. SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments. SIRT5 knock-out cells expressed higher basal levels of innate immunity markers and mounted a stronger antiviral response, independently of the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling Protein MAVS.

Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples has revealed the composition of human gut microbiomes, but we remain less familiar with the spatial organization of microbes between regions such as lumen and mucosa, as well as the microbial genes that regulate this organization. To discover the determinants of spatial organization in the gut, we simulate mucosal colonization over time using an in vitro culture approach incorporating mucin hydrogel microcosms with a complex yet defined community of 123 human strains for which we generated high-quality genome assemblies. Tracking strain abundance longitudinally using shotgun metagenomic measurements, we observe distinct and strain-specific spatial organization in our cultures with strains enriched on mucin microcosms versus in supernatant, reminiscent of mucosa versus lumen enrichment in vivo. Our high taxonomic resolution data enables a comprehensive search for microbial genes that underlie this spatial organization. We identify gene families positively associated with microcosm-enrichment, including several known for biofilm and adhesion functions such as efflux pumps, gene expression regulation, and membrane proteases, as well as a novel link between a coenzyme F420 hydrogenase gene family and lipo/exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Our strain-resolved abundance measurements also demonstrate that incorporation of microcosms yields a more diverse community than liquid-only culture by allowing co-existence of closely related strains. Altogether these findings demonstrate that microcosm culture with synthetic communities can effectively simulate lumen versus mucosal regions in the gut, providing measurements of microbial organization with high taxonomic resolution to enable identification of specific bacterial genes and functions associated with spatial structure.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.13.507837,1.0,new results,2022-09-13 00:00:00,09/13/2022,,Xiaofan Jin; Feiqiao B.

Here, we developed a Single-Molecule Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) that overcomes this problem by employing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to quantify target proteins based on the colocalization of fluorescent signal from orthogonally labeled capture and detection antibodies. By specifically counting colocalized signals, we can eliminate the effects of background produced by non-specific binding of detection antibodies. Using TNF-α, we show that SiMCA achieves a three-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays and exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such as serum and blood.

AAVs with enhanced properties, such as more efficient and/or cell-type specific infection, can be engineered by creating a large, diverse starting library and screening for desired phenotypes, in some cases iteratively. Although this approach has succeeded in numerous specific cases, such as infecting cell types from the brain to the lung, the starting libraries often contain a high proportion of variants unable to assemble or package their genomes, a general prerequisite for engineering any gene delivery goal. Herein, we develop and showcase a machine learning (ML)-based method for systematically designing more effective starting libraries -- ones that have broadly good packaging capabilities while being as diverse as possible. Such carefully designed but general libraries stand to significantly increase the chance of success in engineering any property of interest. Furthermore, we use this approach to design a clinically-relevant AAV peptide insertion library that achieves 5-fold higher packaging fitness than the state-of-the-art library, with negligible reduction in diversity. We demonstrate the general utility of this designed library on a downstream task to which our approach was agnostic: infection of primary human brain tissue. The ML-designed library had approximately 10-fold more successful variants than the current state-of-the-art library. Not only should our new library serve useful for any number of other engineering goals, but our library design approach itself can also be applied to other types of libraries for AAV and beyond.",,,biorxiv;2021.11.02.467003,3.0,new results,2022-09-15 00:00:00,09/15/2022,,Danqing Zhu; David H.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,,,,,2022-09-16 00:00:00,2022/09/15,2022/9/16,Brent Townshend; Matias Kaplan; Christina D Smolke,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.","Brent Townshend: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Matias Kaplan: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Christina D Smolke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.",,,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,9,0

This problem may be even harder when the host cell in question is the enucleated red blood cell. Evolution has provided P. falciparum and related single-celled parasites within the phylum Apicomplexa with a collection of organelles at their apical end that mediate invasion. This apical complex includes at least two sets of secretory organelles, micronemes and rhoptries, and several structural features like apical rings and a putative pore through which proteins may be introduced into the host cell during invasion. In this paper, we perform cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) on isolated merozoites to visualize the apical machinery. Through tomography reconstruction of cellular compartments, we see new details of known structures like the rhoptry tip interacting directly with a rosette resembling the recently described rhoptry-secretory-apparatus (RSA), or with an apical vesicle docked beneath the RSA. Subtomogram averaging reveals that the apical rings have a fixed number of repeating units, each of which is similar in overall size and shape to the units in the apical rings of tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii. Comparison of these polar rings in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma parasites also reveals them to have a structurally conserved assembly patterning.

Mapping phenotypes onto underlying sequence space at first- and higher order levels in order to independently quantify the impact of given nucleotides or residues along a sequence is critical to understanding sequence-phenotype relationships.

ResultsWe developed a Python software tool, ortho_seqs, that quantifies higher order sequence-phenotype interactions based on our previously published method of applying multivariate tensor-based orthogonal polynomials to biological sequences. Using this method, nucleotide or amino acid sequence information is converted to vectors, which are then used to build and compute the first- and higher order tensor-based orthogonal polynomials. We derived a more complete version of the mathematical method that includes projections that not only quantify effects of given nucleotides at a particular site, but also identify the effects of nucleotide substitutions. We show proof of concept of this method, provide a use case example as applied to synthetic antibody sequences, and demonstrate the application of ortho_seqs to other other sequence-phenotype datasets.

We hypothesized that the failure of common bacterial defenses creates selective pressure for immune systems that target the unique jumbo phage biology. Here, we identify the ""jumbo phage killer"" (Juk) immune system that is deployed by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to resist [ovbar]KZ. Juk immunity rescues the cell by preventing early phage transcription, DNA replication, and nucleus assembly. Phage infection is first sensed by JukA (formerly YaaW), which localizes rapidly to the site of phage infection at the cell pole, triggered by ejected phage factors. The effector protein JukB is recruited by JukA, which is required to enable immunity and the subsequent degradation of the phage DNA. JukA homologs are found in several bacterial phyla and are associated with numerous other putative effectors, many of which provided specific anti-[ovbar]KZ activity when expressed in P. aeruginosa.

Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics revealed that E. lenta uses acetate as a key carbon source while catabolizing arginine to generate ATP, traits which could be recapitulated in silico by our updated metabolic model. We compared these in vitro findings with metabolite shifts observed in E. lenta-colonized gnotobiotic mice, identifying shared signatures across environments and highlighting catabolism of the host signaling metabolite agmatine as an alternative energy pathway.

Antibody responses from serologic surveys can provide an estimate of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at the population level.

ObjectiveTo estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and re-infection in eastern Uganda using serologic surveillance from 2020 to early 2022.

DesignPlasma samples from participants in the Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda (PRISM) Border Cohort were obtained at four sampling intervals: October-November 2020; March-April 2021; August-September 2021; and February-March 2022. Setting: Tororo and Busia districts, Uganda.

Participants1,483 samples from 441 participants living in 76 households were tested. Each participant contributed up to 4 time points for SARS-CoV-2 serology, with almost half of all participants contributing at all 4 time points, and almost 90% contributing at 3 or 4 time points. Information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status was collected from participants, with the earliest reported vaccinations in the cohort occurring in May 2021.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The main outcomes of this study were antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as measured with a bead-based serologic assay. Individual-level outcomes were aggregated to population-level SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and boosting rates. Estimates were weighted by the local age distribution based on census data.

ResultsBy the end of the Delta wave and before widespread vaccination, nearly 70% of the study population had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the subsequent Omicron wave, 85% of unvaccinated, previously seronegative individuals were infected for the first time, and [~]50% or more of unvaccinated, already seropositive individuals were likely re-infected, leading to an overall 96% seropositivity in this population. Our results suggest a lower probability of re-infection in individuals with higher pre-existing antibody levels. We found evidence of household clustering of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. We found no significant associations between SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and gender, household size, or recent Plasmodium falciparum malaria exposure.

Conclusions and RelevanceFindings from this study are consistent with very high infection rates and re-infection rates for SARS-CoV-2 in a rural population from eastern Uganda throughout the pandemic.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.20.22280170,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-09-21 00:00:00,09/21/2022,,Jessica Briggs; Saki Takahashi; Patience Nayebare; Gloria Cuu; John Rek; Maato Zedi; Timothy Kizza; Emmanuel Arinaitwe; Joaniter I.

However, the size and complexity of these Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes it difficult to perform exploratory analyses. To aid in data exploration, we have developed AIRRscape, an R Shiny-based interactive web browser application that enables B-cell receptor (BCR) and antibody feature discovery through comparisons among multiple repertoires. Using AIRR-seq data as input, AIRRscape starts by aggregating and sorting repertoires into interactive and explorable bins of germline V-gene, germline J-gene, and CDR3 length, providing a high-level view of the entire repertoire. Interesting subsets of repertoires can be quickly identified and selected, and then network topologies of CDR3 motifs can be generated for further exploration. Here we demonstrate AIRRscape using patient BCR repertoires and sequences of published monoclonal antibodies to investigate patterns of humoral immunity to three viral pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and DENV (dengue virus). AIRRscape reveals convergent antibody sequences among datasets for all three pathogens, although HIV-1 antibody datasets display limited convergence and idiosyncratic responses. We have made AIRRscape available as a web-based Shiny application, along with code on GitHub to encourage its open development and use by immuno-informaticians, virologists, immunologists, vaccine developers, and other scientists that are interested in exploring and comparing multiple immune receptor repertoires.",,,,,,2022-09-21 00:00:00,2022/09/20,2022/9/21,Eric Waltari; Saba Nafees; Krista M McCutcheon; Joan Wong; John E Pak,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.","Eric Waltari: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.Saba Nafees: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.Krista M McCutcheon: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.Joan Wong: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.John E Pak: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.",,,10.1101/2022.03.24.485594,,,0

Disruption of these processes has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders including Huntingtons Disease (HD). While several treatments for physical and psychiatric HD symptoms target dopaminergic neuromodulation, the mechanism by which dopaminergic dysfunction occurs during HD is unknown. This is partly due to limited capability to visualize dopamine dynamics at the spatiotemporal resolution of both neuromodulator release (ms) and dopaminergic boutons ({micro}m). Here we employ near-infrared fluorescent catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to image dopamine release within the brain striatum of R6/2 Huntingtons Disease Model (R6/2) mice. We find that stimulated dorsal striatal dopamine release decreases with progressive motor degeneration and that these decreases are primarily driven by a decrease in the number of dopamine hotspots combined with decreased release intensity and decreased release fidelity. Using nIRCats high spatial resolution, we show that dopamine hotspots in late HD show increased ability to add new dopamine hotspots at high extracellular calcium concentrations and track individual dopamine hotspots over repeated stimulations and pharmacological wash to measure dopamine hotspots release fidelity. Compellingly, we demonstrate that antagonism of D2-autoreceptors using Sulpiride and direct blocking of Kv1.2 channels using 4-Aminopyradine (4-AP) increases the fidelity of dopamine hotspot activity in WT striatum but not in late HD striatum, indicating that D2-autoreceptor regulation of dopamine release through Kv1.2 channels is compromised in late HD. These findings, enabled by nIRCats, provide a more detailed look into how dopamine release is disrupted and dysregulated during Huntingtons Disease to alter the coverage of dopamine modulation across the dorsal striatum.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHuntingtons Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Dysfunction of dopamine signaling is known to deteriorate in HD but has not been studied at the spatial level of individual release sites. Here, we image dopamine release from individual hotspots in brain slices from R6/2 HD mice at early and late disease timepoints with dopamine nanosensors. We track single dopamine hotspots and find that dopamine hotspot number, release intensity, and release fidelity decrease in HD, and demonstrate that changes in D2-autoreceptor regulation manifest through changes in hotspot release fidelity thus compromising dopamine coverage across the dorsal lateral striatum. These findings highlight dopaminergic neurons in cortico-striatal signaling during HD as a promising new therapeutic target for HD treatment.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.19.508617,1.0,new results,2022-09-21 00:00:00,09/21/2022,,Sarah J.

We investigated mechanisms of ICI resistance using engineered mouse models with increased neoantigen burden and T cell infiltration. We found that in ICI-resistant tumours, T cells upregulate an NF-{kappa}B-driven inflammatory circuit in the tumour microenvironment (TME), culminating in PMN-MDSC recruitment and tumour escape. This resistance circuit was molecularly driven by IL-1, TNF, and G-CSF, and their genetic or pharmacologic inhibition increased ICI efficacy. Furthermore, we identified a subset of human TNF-expressing T cells that expand following ICI therapy and are associated with increased tumour NF-{kappa}B signaling. These data reveal a surprising mechanism of ICI resistance whereby T cells instruct NF-{kappa}B-mediated inflammation to paradoxically drive a resistance circuit in participating tumours, refining our understanding of ICI response and resistance with important therapeutic implications.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.20.508732,1.0,new results,2022-09-22 00:00:00,09/22/2022,,Nam Woo Cho; Sophia M.

Despite the importance of recurrent circuits for cortical processing, the basic rules that govern how nearby cortical neurons influence each other remains enigmatic. We used two-photon holographic optogenetics to activate ensembles of neurons in Layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1) in the absence of external stimuli to isolate the impact of local recurrence from external inputs. We find that the spatial arrangement and the stimulus feature preference of both the stimulated and the target ensemble jointly determine the net effect of recurrent activity, defining the cortical activity patterns that drive competition versus facilitation in L2/3 circuits. Computational modeling suggests that a combination of highly local recurrent excitatory connectivity and selective convergence onto inhibitory neurons give rise to these principles of recurrent activity.

As cell size increases, some proteins become more concentrated while others are diluted. As a result, the state of the cell changes continuously with increasing size. In addition to these proteomic changes, large cells have a lower growth rate (protein synthesis rate per unit volume). That both the cell's proteome and growth rate change with cell size suggests they may be interdependent. To test this, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to measure how the proteome changes in response to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which decreases the cellular growth rate and has only a minimal effect on cell size. We found that large cell size and mTOR inhibition, both of which lower the growth rate of a cell, remodel the proteome in similar ways. This suggests that many of the effects of cell size are mediated by the size-dependent slowdown of the cellular growth rate. For example, the previously reported size-dependent expression of some senescence markers could reflect a cell's declining growth rate rather than its size ",cell size; growth rate; mTOR; protein synthesis rate; quantitative proteomics; rapamycin; senescence,,,,,2022-09-23 00:00:00,2022/09/05,2022/9/23,Evgeny Zatulovskiy; Michael C Lanz; Shuyuan Zhang; Frank McCarthy; Joshua E Elias; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.","Evgeny Zatulovskiy: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.Michael C Lanz: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Shuyuan Zhang: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.Frank McCarthy: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Joshua E Elias: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Jan M Skotheim: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.",,,,,,0

Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel. We find that this policy is successful in decreasing the epidemic size and slowing down the spread, but less effective than the shelter-in-place policy.

MethodsWe matched spatiotemporal temperature, precipitation, surface water, and humidity data to data from a trial in rural Bangladesh that measured diarrhea and enteropathogen prevalence in children 0-2 years from 2012-2016. We fit generalized additive models and estimated percent changes in prevalence using projected precipitation under Shared Socio-Economic pathways describing sustainable development (SSP1), middle of the road (SSP2), and fossil fuel development (SSP5) scenarios.

FindingsAn increase from 15{degrees}C to 30{degrees}C in weekly average temperature was associated with 5.0% higher diarrhea, 6.4% higher Norovirus, and 13.0% higher STEC prevalence. Above-median precipitation was associated with 1.27-fold (95% CI 0.99, 1.61) higher diarrhea; higher Cryptosporidium, tEPEC, ST-ETEC, STEC, Shigella, EAEC, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, and Adenovirus 40/41; and lower aEPEC, Giardia, Sapovirus, and Norovirus prevalence. Other associations were weak or null. Compared to the study period, diarrhea prevalence was similar under SSP1 (7%), 3.4% (2.7%, 4.3%) higher under SSP2, and 5.7% (4.4%, 7.0%) higher under SSP5. Prevalence of pathogens responsible for a large share of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in this setting (Shigella, Aeromonas) were 13-20% higher under SSP2 and SSP5.

InterpretationHigher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher prevalence of diarrhea and multiple enteropathogens; higher precipitation was associated with lower prevalence of some enteric viruses. Under likely climate change scenarios, we projected increased prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens responsible for clinical illness. Our findings inform pathogen-specific adaptation and mitigation strategies and priorities for vaccine development.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and Scopus for studies published from January 1, 2000 to present using the following three queries: 1) child; and diarrhea OR ""enteric infection""; and meteorological OR environmental OR ""surface water"" OR ""standing water""; and risk AND/OR factors; 2) Climate AND change AND project* AND diarrhea OR diarrhoea; 3) climate AND change AND project* OR model AND enter* AND infect* AND E. coli. Studies generally focused on individual risk factors for diarrhea transmission or enteric infection, with an emphasis on temperature and precipitation. Studies found that higher temperatures were associated with higher incidence of bacterial diarrhea and lower incidence of viral diarrhea; few studies have investigated associations between temperature and parasitic diarrhea. Heavy rainfall, particularly after dry periods, was associated with higher diarrhea prevalence, though heavy rainfall during rainy seasons was found to protect against diarrhea incidence. Similarly, flooding of surface water and shallow wells was also associated with higher diarrhea prevalence. Very few studies investigated associations between diarrhea or enteropathogen carriage and surface water presence, or humidity. A recent individual participant meta-analysis of studies in 19 low- and middle-income countries found that higher precipitation was associated with a small decrease in enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Campylobacter spp. prevalence and no difference in Shigella, Cryptosporidium, or Giardia, or enteric virus prevalence. Weekly average temperature increases of 10-40{degrees} C within the study period were associated with higher risk of Campylobacter, ETEC, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and adenovirus, and lower risk of sapovirus and rotavirus, and generally, associations were stronger. Higher humidity was associated with higher risk of enteric bacterial infections and lower risk of enteric virus infection. A small number of studies have projected diarrhea under climate change in low- and middle-income countries. Studies have estimated a 15-20% increase in global diarrhea risk in 2040-2069 relative to 1961-1990, up to 21% increase in diarrhea incidence in northern India from 2013 to the 2040s, 3-10% increase in diarrhea cases in the Gaza Strip associated with 1.5{degrees} to 2{degrees}C increases in temperature, and an 8% increase in diarrhea burden by 2050 in Nepal. One study estimated an additional 1,625,073 ETEC diarrhea cases in Bangladesh from 2046-2065 due to climate change. No studies estimated changes in the presence of multiple enteropathogens under possible climate change scenarios.

Added value of this studyThis study matched remote sensing data on precipitation, temperature, surface water, and humidity to data on diarrhea and enteropathogen carriage in children under 2 years from a trial in rural Bangladesh. We fit flexible models to investigate potentially non-linear relationships between each climate and environmental risk factor and each health outcome. In addition, we predicted the prevalence of each outcome under three possible climate change scenarios. Our predictions leveraged the spatiotemporal distributions of both climate precipitation projections and diarrhea and enteropathogen carriage in the trial. To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict prevalence under climate change scenarios for both diarrhea and multiple enteropathogens in a rural, low-resource south Asian setting. Our study sheds light on how climate change may impact diarrhea and enteropathogen carriage in Bangladesh, which is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its low altitude and seasonal flooding.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found that both higher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher diarrhea prevalence, consistent with prior studies. Compared to prior studies, which have primarily found associations between diarrhea and heavy rainfall following a dry period, we found that moderate levels of weekly precipitation were associated with higher diarrhea prevalence. Relationships between climatic and environmental variables and enteropathogen carriage varied by taxa, as other studies have found, but for some pathogens and risk factors, we observed associations in different directions than prior studies. Under middle of the road and fossil fuel-based development climate change scenarios, we projected increased diarrhea prevalence and taxa-specific changes in enteropathogen prevalence. Our findings suggest that climate change may exacerbate diarrhea burden in rural Bangladesh in the absence of sustainable development and inform prioritization of pathogen-specific mitigation and/or adaptation interventions (e.g., vaccines) for young children in rural, South Asian settings under climate change.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.26.22280367,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-09-27 00:00:00,09/27/2022,,Jessica A.

Our analysis confirms an increase in nonclonal somatic mutation in single neurons with age, but revises the estimated rate of this accumulation to 16 SNVs per year. We also identify artifacts in other amplification methods. Most importantly, we show that somatic indels increase by at least three per year per neuron and are enriched in functional regions of the genome such as enhancers and promoters.

We investigated if climate and environment modified the effect of low-cost, point-of-use water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) interventions on diarrhea and predicted intervention effectiveness under climate change scenarios.

MethodsWe analyzed data from a cluster-randomized trial in rural Bangladesh that measured diarrhea prevalence in children 0-2 years from 2012-2016. We matched remote sensing data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and surface water to households by location and measurement date. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for WASH interventions vs. control stratified by environmental factors using generative additive models and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. We estimated intervention effects under predicted precipitation in the study region in 2050 for climate change scenarios from different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).

FindingsWASH interventions more effectively prevented diarrhea under higher levels of total precipitation in the previous week and when there was heavy rain in the previous week (heavy rainfall PR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.62 vs. no heavy rainfall PR = 0.77, 0.60-0.98). We did not detect substantial effect modification by other environmental variables. WASH intervention effectiveness increased under most climate change scenarios; in a fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5), the PR was 0.46 (0.44-0.48) compared to 0.67 (0.65-0.68) in the study.

InterpretationWASH interventions had the strongest effect on diarrhea under higher precipitation, and effectiveness may increase under climate change without sustainable development. WASH interventions may improve population resilience to climate-related health risks.

Research in Context PanelO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar using the search terms ""sanitation"" OR ""hygiene"" OR ""WASH"" OR ""water quality""; and ""heterogen*"" or ""effect modif*""; and ""climate"" OR ""environmental""; and ""diarrhea"" OR ""enteric infection""; and ""risk"" AND/OR ""factors"". In general, the effect modification of sanitation and hygiene on diarrhea or enteropathogen infection by climate and environment is not well studied. One study in Ecuador investigated different relationships between rainfall, diarrhea, and unimproved sanitation and water sources. They found that poor sanitation was most strongly associated with elevated diarrhea after precipitation minimums, whereas poor water sources were most strongly associated with elevated diarrhea after precipitation maximums. One study in Rwanda also found that high levels of runoff were protective against diarrhea only in households with unimproved toilets. In Bangladesh, one study found that access to tubewells was most effective at reducing childhood diarrhea in non-flood controlled areas. No prior studies have projected changes in WASH effectiveness under different climate change scenarios.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first study to assess differences in WASH intervention effectiveness for multiple environmental variables and the first to predict future intervention effectiveness under different climate change scenarios. We spatiotemporally matched individual-level data from a trial in rural Bangladesh to remote sensing data on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and surface water presence. We compared the effectiveness of WASH interventions to prevent diarrhea under different levels of potential environmental effect modifiers. We then used climate models with high spatiotemporal resolution to predict changes in intervention effectiveness under different climate change scenarios.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found that WASH interventions were more effective under increasing precipitation and following heavy rain (over 80th percentile) events. Prior studies have found that diarrhea tends to increase with rainfall. Several studies have documented that precipitation-associated increases in diarrhea occurred primarily after heavy rain that followed dry periods, but we found that WASH intervention effectiveness in preventing diarrhea was higher even at moderate precipitation levels that were not necessarily preceded by a dry period. Under climate change scenarios with higher precipitation, we projected that WASH interventions may become more effective. In settings similar to rural Bangladesh, our findings suggest that regions that are expected to experience greater rainfall should be prioritized for intervention installation, promotion, and maintenance and that these activities might be most impactful during the rainy season.",,,medrxiv;2022.09.25.22280229,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-09-27 00:00:00,09/27/2022,,Anna T.

However, its spatial and temporal resolution largely relies on the brightness of ON/OFF switchable fluorescent dyes. Moreover, in cell plasma membranes, the single-molecule localization is hampered by the fast lateral diffusion of membrane probes. Here, to address these two fundamental problems, we propose a concept of ON/OFF switchable probes for SMLM (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography, PAINT) based on fluorogenic dimers of bright cyanine dyes. In these probes, the two cyanine units connected with a linker were modified at their extremities with low-affinity membrane anchors. Being self-quenched in water due to intramolecular dye H-aggregation, they displayed light up on reversible binding to lipid membranes. The charged group in the linker further decreased the probe affinity to the lipid membranes, thus accelerating its dynamic reversible ON/OFF switching. The concept was validated on cyanines 3 and 5. SMLM of live cells revealed that the new probes provided higher brightness and ∼10-fold slower diffusion at the cell surface, compared to reference probes Nile Red and DiD, which boosted axial localization precision >3-fold down to 31 nm. The new probe allowed unprecedented observation of nanoscale fibrous protrusions on plasma membranes of live cells with 40 s time resolution, revealing their fast dynamics. Thus, going beyond the brightness limit of single switchable dyes by cooperative dequenching in fluorogenic dimers and slowing down probe diffusion in biomembranes open the route to significant enhancement of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of live cells.",,,,,,2022-09-27 00:00:00,2022/09/26,2022/9/27,Ilya O Aparin; Rui Yan; Rémi Pelletier; Alexander A Choi; Dmytro I Danylchuk; Ke Xu; Andrey S Klymchenko,,"Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.","Ilya O Aparin: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Rui Yan: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Rémi Pelletier: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Alexander A Choi: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Dmytro I Danylchuk: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Ke Xu: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Andrey S Klymchenko: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.",,,,,,0

Here we show that the material properties of these condensates are determined by a balance between attractive and repulsive forces mediated by a helical oligomerization domain and an expanded disordered region, respectively. A series of PopZ mutants disrupting this balance results in condensates that span the material properties spectrum, from liquid to solid.

Tmem95 knockout murine sperm can bind to, but do not fuse with, eggs. How TMEM95 plays a role in membrane fusion of sperm and eggs has remained elusive. Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for a specific, receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs and suggest that this interaction may have a role in facilitating membrane fusion during fertilization.",TMEM95; fertilization; membrane fusion; sperm–egg fusion,,,,,2022-09-27 00:00:00,2022/09/26,2022/9/27,Shaogeng Tang; Yonggang Lu; Will M Skinner; Mrinmoy Sanyal; Polina V Lishko; Masahito Ikawa; Peter S Kim,,"Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, CA 94945.; Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Experimental Genome Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Experimental Genome Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Laboratory of Reproductive Systems Biology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.","Shaogeng Tang: Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Yonggang Lu: Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Experimental Genome Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.Will M Skinner: Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.Mrinmoy Sanyal: Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Polina V Lishko: Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, CA 94945.Masahito Ikawa: Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Experimental Genome Research, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.; Laboratory of Reproductive Systems Biology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.Peter S Kim: Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.",,,10.1101/2022.06.10.495573,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.06.10.495573,12,0

Given that brief intervention can effectively reduce hazardous alcohol consumption, this study aimed to investigate how hypertensive patients with concomitant alcohol use are identified and treated in Thai primary care settings and what this may mean for screening and lifestyle intervention strategies. In a cross-sectional, mixed-method design, we surveyed 91 participants from three different groups of Thai stakeholders: policy- and decisionmakers; healthcare practitioners; and patients diagnosed with hypertension. Data was collected between December 2020 and May 2021. Responses were analyzed descriptively and using open coding tools to identify current practices, barriers, facilitators, and implications for interventions. All stakeholder groups regarded alcohol use as an important driver of hypertension. While lifestyle interventions among hypertensive patients were perceived as beneficial, current lifestyle support was limited. Barriers included limited resources in primary healthcare facilities, lack of continuous monitoring or follow-up, missing tools or procedures for risk assessment and lifestyle intervention, and stigmatization of alcohol use. Our results suggest that although screening for lifestyle risk factors (including alcohol use) and lifestyle interventions are not yet sufficiently established, a wide range of stakeholders still recognize the potential of interventions targeted at hazardous alcohol use among hypertensive patients.

Rheological measurements to understand these flow-induced properties in soft condensed matter and biology are critical to optimize manufacturing processes that rely upon the use of complex fluids, such as the creation of viscoelastic bioinks for 3D bioprinting. While typical rheological characterizations are performed on bulky and expensive rheometers, these options do not readily enable in situ microscopic visualization of flow behavior, which can provide microstructural insights into the mechanisms and patterns of yielding. To address these limitations, we present a visual, inexpensive (approximately $200), and wireless capillary rheometer (VIEWR) assembled from chiefly 3D printed components. We validate the accuracy and reliability of the portable rheometer by comparing measurements of multiple rheological parameters, including viscosity and yield stress, with measurements obtained from a commercial oscillatory rheometer. At its core, VIEWR employs an easily interchangeable glass capillary channel to enable real-time microscopic observation under flow conditions. To facilitate various experimental conditions, a communication protocol based on Internet of Things (IoT) is adapted to support wireless transmission of data. This unique rheometer design can be used for characterizing and visualizing numerous living and non-living complex fluids.

We predicted that 43% of HARs have variants with large opposing effects on chromatin state and 14% on neurodevelopmental enhancer activity. This pattern, consistent with compensatory evolution, was confirmed using massively parallel reporter assays in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells. The species-specific enhancer activity of assayed HARs was accurately predicted from the presence and absence of transcription factor footprints in each species. Despite these striking cis effects, activity of a given HAR sequence was nearly identical in human and chimpanzee cells. These findings suggest that HARs did not evolve to compensate for changes in the trans environment but instead altered their ability to bind factors present in both species. Thus, ML prioritized variants with functional effects on human neurodevelopment and revealed an unexpected reason why HARs may have evolved so rapidly.",,,biorxiv;256313,4.0,new results,2022-09-28 00:00:00,09/28/2022,,Sean Whalen; Fumitaka Inoue; Hane Ryu; Tyler Fairr; Eirene Markenscoff-Papadimitriou; Kathleen Keough; Martin Kircher; Beth Martin; Beatriz Alvarado; Orry Elor; Dianne Laboy Cintron; Alex Williams; Md.

The dysregulation of ceramide metabolism has been implicated in cancer evasion of apoptosis and targeting ceramide metabolism has potential therapeutic benefits as a strategy to kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to ceramide-mediated cell death are vastly intertwined and incompletely understood. To shed light on this mystery, we performed a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify regulators of cancer resistance to the soluble short chain ceramide, C6 ceramide (C6-Cer). Our results reveal a complex landscape of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity, including genes associated with ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and membrane biology. Furthermore, we find that loss of the phospholipid flippase subunit TMEM30A impairs the plasma membrane trafficking of its binding partner the P4-type ATPase ATP11B, and depletion of TMEM30A or ATP11B disrupts plasma membrane asymmetry and promotes resistance to C6-Cer toxicity independent of alterations in C6-Cer uptake.

In recent years, manyadvancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines,and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especiallycomplex polygonal geometries. In this work, we focus on developing ageneral-purpose polygon encoding model, which can encode a polygonal geometry(with or without holes, single or multipolygons) into an embedding space. Theresult embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream taskssuch as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. Toachieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirableproperties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutationinvariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties. We conductexperiments on two tasks: 1) shape classification based on MNIST; 2) spatialrelation prediction based on two new datasets - DBSR-46K and DBSR-cplx46K. Ourresults show that NUFTspec and ResNet1D outperform multiple existing baselineswith significant margins. While ResNet1D suffers from model performancedegradation after shape-invariance geometry modifications, NUFTspec is veryrobust to these modifications due to the nature of the NUFT.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15458,arXiv:2209.15458v1,,,09/29/2022,09/29/2022,,Gengchen Mai; Chiyu Jiang; Weiwei Sun; Rui Zhu; Yao Xuan; Ling Cai; Krzysztof Janowicz; Stefano Ermon; Ni Lao,,,,,,,,,1

By interrogating the integrated datasets across multiple levels of cellular resolution, we infer 50-100% more enhancer-gene links than prior approaches, and show that the aggregate accessibility at linked enhancers for highly-regulated genes predicts expression. We use these gene-regulatory maps to prioritize cell types, genes, and causal variants implicated in the pathobiology of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), eczema, and other complex traits. AGA GWAS signals are strongly and specifically enriched in dermal papilla cell open chromatin regions, supporting the role of these cells as key drivers of AGA pathogenesis. Finally, we trained machine-learning models to nominate SNPs that affect gene expression through disruption of specific transcription factor binding motifs, identifying candidate functional SNPs linked to expression of WNT10A in AGA and IL18RAP in eczema. Together, this work reveals principles of gene regulation and identifies gene regulatory consequences of natural genetic variation in complex skin and hair diseases.",,,biorxiv;2022.09.28.509620,1.0,new results,2022-09-29 00:00:00,09/29/2022,,Benjamin Ober-Reynolds; Chen Wang; Justin M.

However, existing methods for conducting TWAS do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We introduce CONTENT-a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We apply CONTENT to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell RNA-seq data sets and show that CONTENT leads to a 42% (bulk) and 110% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. We find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75% in single-cell data, consistent with cell-type heterogeneity in bulk tissue.

We quantified how viruses and their hosts respond to the first rainfall of the year in seasonally dry soils - a moment commonly referred to as ""wet-up"", when resident soil microbes are both resuscitated and lysed, with a disproportionately large effect on annual carbon turnover. We applied time-resolved metagenomics, viromics, and quantitative stable isotope probing to track spatiotemporal virus-host trends, and quantify cell death (and by proxy, the amount of biomass carbon released). Dry soil is a sparse yet diverse reservoir of putative virions, of which only a subset thrives following wet-up. A massive degradation of distinct viruses occurs within 24h post wet-up, but after one-week, viral biomass increased by up to seven-fold. Thriving viruses were not induced temperate phages. Our measures of viral-mediated microbial host death indicate that viruses drive a consistent rate of cell lysis after wet-up. These calculations - the first to demonstrate the quantitative impact of viral effects on soil microbiomes and carbon cycling - evidence that viruses significantly impact microbial community assembly.

To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from 'sizers', in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to 'adders', in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks. If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells in vivo, sizers become more likely.

Our objectives were to characterize the phenotype of patients with Nodding Syndrome, investigate potential contributors to disease etiology, and evaluate response to immunotherapy. This cohort study investigated members of a single-family unit from Lamwo District, Uganda. The participants for this study were selected by the Ugandan Ministry of Health as representative for Nodding Syndrome and with a conducive family structure for genomic analyses. Of the eight family members who participated in the study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, three had Nodding Syndrome. The three affected patients were extensively evaluated with metagenomic sequencing for infectious pathogens, exome sequencing, spinal fluid immune analyses, neurometabolic and toxicology testing, continuous electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. Five unaffected family members underwent a subset of testing for comparison. A distinctive interictal pattern of sleep-activated bursts of generalized and multifocal epileptiform discharges and slowing was observed in two patients. Brain imaging showed two patients had mild generalized cerebral atrophy, and both patients and unaffected family members had excessive metal deposition in the basal ganglia. Trace metal biochemical evaluation was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was non-inflammatory, and one patient had CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands. Onchocerca volvulus specific antibodies were present in all patients and skin snips were negative for active onchocerciasis. Metagenomic sequencing of serum and CSF revealed hepatitis B virus in the serum of one patient. Vitamin B6 metabolites were borderline low in all family members, and CSF pyridoxine metabolites were normal. Mitochondrial DNA testing was normal. Exome sequencing did not identify potentially causal candidate gene variants. Nodding Syndrome is characterized by a distinctive pattern of sleep-activated epileptiform activity. The associated growth stunting may be due to hypothalamic dysfunction. Extensive testing years after disease onset did not clarify a causal etiology.

The discovery of conserved genes in viruses infecting geographically and phylogenetically diverse hosts has provided important evolutionary context for human and animal pathogens. However, the resulting viral genomes are often incomplete, and analyses largely characterize the distribution of viruses over their dynamics. Here, we show how the accumulated data of metagenomic studies can be integrated to reveal geographic and evolutionary dynamics in a case study of Orthomyxoviridae, the family of RNA viruses containing influenza virus. First, we use sequences of the orthomyxovirid W[u]han mosquito virus 6 to track the global migrations of its host. We then look at overall orthomyxovirus genome evolution, finding significant gene gain and loss across members of the family, especially in the surface proteins responsible for cell and host tropism. We find that the surface protein of W[u]han mosquito virus 6 exhibits accelerated non-synonymous evolution suggestive of antigenic evolution, and an entire quaranjavirid group bearing highly diverged surface proteins. Finally we quantify the progress of orthomyxovirus discovery and forecast that many highly diverged Orthomyxoviridae members remain to be found. We argue that continued metagenomic studies will be fruitful for understanding the dynamics, evolution, ecology of viruses and their hosts, regardless of whether novel viruses are actually identified or not, as long as study designs allowing for the resolution of complete viral genomes are employed.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.31.505987,3.0,new results,01/16/2023,01/16/2023,,Gytis Dudas; Joshua Batson,"Dudas, G.; Batson, J.","Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub","Gytis Dudas, Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University], [Joshua Batson, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,,,,1

In the airway, basal stem cells differentiate into both multiciliated and secretory cells, which together protect the lungs from inhaled pathogens and particulates. To define how airway stem cells differentiate, we mapped differentiation trajectories using single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identified a transitional intermediate cell state in between basal stem cells and differentiated cells. These intermediate cells induce different gene expression programs that precede differentiation into either multiciliated or secretory cells. For example, we found that within the intermediate cell population, multiciliated cell precursors express Mycl, encoding a MYC-family transcription factor, and secretory cell precursors express Hey1, encoding a transcriptional repressor. We also found that Notch signaling acts on intermediate cells to repress Mycl and induce Hey1. We further show MYCL expression is sufficient to drive multiciliated cell fate, whereas HEY1 expression is sufficient to repress multiciliated cell fate. Using CUT&RUN, we made the surprising observation that MYCL and HEY1 bind to many of the same regulatory elements near genes encoding early regulators of multiciliated cell differentiation. We conclude that intermediate cells receiving Notch signals induce HEY1 to repress the multiciliated cell fate and become secretory cells, while intermediate cells not receiving Notch signals induce MYCL to promote the multiciliated cell fate. These experiments reveal that during airway stem cell differentiation Notch signaling balances the production of two different cell types by regulating the functions of two opposing transcription factors, MYCL and HEY1.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.05.511009,1.0,new results,2022-10-05 00:00:00,10/05/2022,,Lauren E.

To facilitate exploration of accelerated evolution in other lineages, we implemented an open-source Nextflow pipeline that runs on any computing platform. Combining deep-learning with chromatin capture experiments in human and chimpanzee neural progenitor cells, we discovered a significant enrichment of HARs in topologically associating domains (TADs) containing human-specific genomic variants that change three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Differential gene expression between humans and chimpanzees at these loci in multiple cell types suggests rewiring of regulatory interactions between HARs and neurodevelopmental genes. Thus, comparative genomics together with models of 3D genome folding revealed enhancer hijacking as an explanation for the rapid evolution of HARs.

To address this issue, we sub-cloned candidate iPSC lines and deeply characterised their genetic properties using whole genome sequencing, their genomic stability upon CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, and their phenotypic properties including differentiation to commonly-used cell types. These studies identified KOLF2.1J as an all-around well-performing iPSC line. We then shared KOLF2.1J with groups around the world who tested its performance in head-to-head comparisons with their own preferred iPSC lines across a diverse range of differentiation protocols and functional assays. On the strength of these findings, we have made KOLF2.1J and hundreds of its gene-edited derivative clones readily accessible to promote the standardization required for large-scale collaborative science in the stem cell field.

SummaryThe authors of this collaborative study deeply characterized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to rationally select a clonally-derived cell line that performs well across multiple modalities. KOLF2.1J was identified as a candidate reference cell line based on single-cell analysis of its gene expression in the pluripotent state, whole genome sequencing, genomic stability after highly efficient CRISPR-mediated gene editing, integrity of the p53 pathway, and the efficiency with which it differentiated into multiple target cell populations. Since it is deeply characterized and can be readily acquired, KOLF2.1J is an attractive reference cell line for groups working with iPSCs.

This isespecially true when applying RL to real-world control tasks, e.g. in thesciences or robotics, where executing a policy in the environment is costly. Inpopular RL algorithms, agents typically explore either by adding stochasticityto a reward-maximizing policy or by attempting to gather maximal informationabout environment dynamics without taking the given task into account. In thiswork, we develop a method that allows us to plan for exploration while takingboth the task and the current knowledge about the dynamics into account. Thekey insight to our approach is to plan an action sequence that maximizes theexpected information gain about the optimal trajectory for the task at hand. Wedemonstrate that our method learns strong policies with 2x fewer samples thanstrong exploration baselines and 200x fewer samples than model free methods ona diverse set of low-to-medium dimensional control tasks in both the open-loopand closed-loop control settings.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04642,arXiv:2210.04642v1,,,10/06/2022,10/06/2022,,Viraj Mehta; Ian Char; Joseph Abbate; Rory Conlin; Mark D.

Transport to lysosomes relies on GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-mediated tagging of soluble enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency leads to the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). Several viruses require lysosomal cathepsins to cleave structural proteins and thus depend on functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. We used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET, also named TMEM251) as essential for infection by cathepsin-dependent viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). LYSET deficiency resulted in global loss of M6P tagging and mislocalization of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from the Golgi complex to lysosomes.

Real-time oxytocin imaging probes with the spatiotemporal resolution relevant to its endogenous signaling are required to fully elucidate oxytocin function in the brain. Herein we describe a near-infrared oxytocin nanosensor (nIROx), a synthetic probe capable of imaging oxytocin in the brain without interference from its structural analogue, vasopressin. nIROx leverages the inherent tissue-transparent fluorescence of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and the molecular recognition capacity of an oxytocin receptor peptide fragment (OXTp) to selectively and reversibly image oxytocin. We employ these nanosensors to monitor electrically stimulated oxytocin release in brain tissue, revealing oxytocin release sites with a median size of 3 m which putatively represents the spatial diffusion of oxytocin from its point of release. These data demonstrate that covalent SWCNT constructs such as nIROx are powerful optical tools that can be leveraged to measure neuropeptide release in brain tissue.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.05.511026,1.0,new results,2022-10-07 00:00:00,10/07/2022,,Nicole Navarro; Sanghwa Jeong; Nicholas Ouassil; Jaewan Mun; Esther Leem; Markita P.

Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) previously described target the native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Envelope (Env), but the relevance of the tiered categories for inhibitors targeting another Env conformation, the pre-hairpin intermediate, is not well understood. Here we show that two inhibitors targeting distinct highly-conserved regions of the pre-hairpin intermediate have strikingly consistent neutralization potencies (within [~]100-fold for a given inhibitor) against strains in all three neutralization tiers of HIV-1; in contrast, best-in-class bnAbs targeting diverse Env epitopes vary by more than 10,000-fold in potency against these strains.

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action tothe AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promisingdirections for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI.

Current serology assays either require a laboratory setting and take >1 hr (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) or are rapid but only qualitative in nature and cannot accurately track antibody levels over time (i.e., lateral flow assay [LFA]). Therefore, there is a need for development of a rapid and simple but also quantitative assay that can evaluate antibody levels in patients accurately over time. We have developed an assay that uses a split nanoluciferase fused to the spike or nucleocapsid proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enable luminescent-based detection of spike- or nucleocapsid-binding antibodies in serum, plasma, and whole blood samples. The resulting approach is simple, rapid, and quantitative and is highly amenable to low-/medium-throughput scale using plate-based assays, high-throughput scale using robotics, and point-of-care applications. In this article, we describe how to perform the assay in a laboratory setting using a plate reader or liquid-handling robotics and in a point-of-care setting using a handheld, battery-powered luminometer. Together, these assays allow antibody detection to be easily performed in multiple settings by simplifying and reducing assay time in a laboratory or clinical environment and by allowing for antibody detection in point-of-care, nonlaboratory settings. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Evidence on CVD risk factor prevalence among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty globally is sparse because studies have used measures of socioeconomic status that are not comparable across study populations and countries. For adults living in extreme poverty, this study aimed to determine i) the prevalence of each of five key CVD risk factors, ii) how the prevalence of these CVD risk factors varies across and within countries, and iii) the level of treatment coverage with statin, antihypertensive, and diabetes therapy.

MethodsWe pooled individual-level data from 105 nationally representative household surveys with physical measurements of hypertension, diabetes, overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as self-reported smoking status, from 78 countries that represent 85% of people living in extreme poverty globally. Those living in extreme poverty were defined by ordering participants according to a continuous household wealth index or household income value, and then applying World Bank estimates on the proportion of each countrys population that is living in extreme poverty. We used modified Poisson regression models to examine how CVD risk factor prevalence among those in extreme poverty varied by age, sex, educational attainment, and rural versus urban residency. We also calculated the proportion of participants with diabetes or hypertension who self-reported the use of blood pressure- or blood glucose-lowering medication, respectively; the proportion with hypertension who achieved blood pressure control; and the proportion recommended for statin use according to WHO guidelines who reported taking a statin.

ResultsOf 32,695,579 participants, 7,922,289 were living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), 15,986,099 on less than $3.20/day, and 23,466,879 on less than $5.50/day. Among those living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), the age-standardized prevalence was 17.5% (95% CI: 16.7% - 18.3%) for hypertension, 4.0% (95% CI: 3.6% - 4.5%) for diabetes, 10.6% (95% CI: 9.0% - 12.3%) for current smoking, 3.1% (95% CI: 2.8% - 3.3%) for obesity, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9% - 1.9%) for dyslipidemia. In most countries in our analysis, the prevalence of these risk factors among those living in extreme poverty was not notably lower than in the total population. Hypertension treatment and control, diabetes treatment, and statin use were low across all poverty levels in low-income countries, while in lower and upper middle-income countries individuals living at more extreme levels of poverty had a lower probability of reporting the use of these medications and achieving hypertension control.

ConclusionsWe found a high prevalence of CVD risk factors among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty, along with low statin use and low treatment rates for diabetes and hypertension. Our detailed analysis and comparison across poverty levels could inform equity discussions for resource allocation and the design of effective interventions.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280861,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-10-10 00:00:00,10/10/2022,,Pascal Geldsetzer; Rebecca L.

Neural networkscan assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manualannotations, while unsupervised approaches have fared poorly in ultrasound todate. Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labelsrequired) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinicaldomain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements. We also tested our pipeline againstexternal images from an additional 10,030 patients (20,060 images) withavailable manual tracings of the left ventricle. Results: r2 between clinicallymeasured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reportedinter-clinician variation for LVESV and LVEDV (pipeline vs. clinical r2= 0.74and r2=0.65, respectively), LVEF and LV mass (r2= 0.46 and r2=0.54), left andright atrium volumes (r2=0.7 and r2=0.6), and right ventricle area (r2=0.47).When binarized into normal vs. abnormal categories, average accuracy was 0.81(range 0.71-0.95). A subset of the test echocardiograms (n=553) hadcorresponding cardiac MRI; correlation between pipeline and CMR measurementswas similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and CMR. Finally, in theexternal dataset, our pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with anaverage Dice score of 0.83 (95% CI 0.83).

Using proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, we identified Numb as a new ciliary protein that positively regulates Hh signaling. Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket and acts as an endocytic adaptor to incorporate Ptch1 into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby promoting Ptch1 exit from the cilium, a key step in Hh signaling activation. Numb loss impaired Sonic Hedgehog-induced Ptch1 departure from the cilium, resulting in severe attenuation of Hh signaling. Genetic ablation of Numb and its homolog Numblike in the developing cerebellum impaired the proliferation of granule cell precursors, a Hh-dependent process, resulting in reduced cerebellar size.

Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 15 human organ donors, 20 tissues, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the healthy human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution. In order to construct this atlas, we developed a computational pipeline which identifies high-confidence microbial sequences from three domains of life within the sea of human transcripts in individual cells, and show that this is a non-trivial search for one in a million sequences. Together with data from a separate validation cohort of 8 additional donors, we identify more than a thousand diverse bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. In characterizing the human tissue microbiome, we demonstrate that individuals harbor unique species associated not just with each tissue but often with particular cell types, and that many of these species remain uncharacterized. Moreover, combining our data with the Human Microbiome Project, the tumor microbiome dataset by Nejman et al., and the PATRIC database, we map the likely microbial flow routes from external-facing microbiomes to internal tissues and tumors, and show the existence of many unexpected routes taken by both commensals and pathogens. We find that [~]30% of bacterial species found in tumors are detectable across healthy tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from healthy tissues, even those from distant sites. Increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantify the microbial load and diversity across different cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells.

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo.

We used sensitivity analyses and bias analyses to explore such discrepancies in a study of the indirect effects of influenza vaccination.

MethodsWe fit an age-structured, deterministic, compartmental model to estimate indirect effects of a school-based influenza vaccination program in California that was evaluated in a previous matched cohort study. To understand discrepancies in their results, we used 1) a model with constrained parameters such that projections matched the cohort study; and 2) probabilistic bias analyses to identify potential biases (e.g., outcome misclassification due to incomplete influenza testing) that, if corrected, would align the empirical results with the mathematical model.

ResultsThe indirect effect estimate (% reduction in influenza hospitalization among older adults in intervention vs. control) was 22.3% (95% CI 7.6% - 37.1%) in the cohort study but only 1.6% (95% Bayesian credible intervals 0.4 - 4.4%) in the mathematical model. When constrained, mathematical models aligned with the cohort study when there was substantially lower pre-existing immunity among school-age children and older adults. Conversely, empirical estimates corrected for potential bias aligned with mathematical model estimates only if influenza testing rates were 15-23% lower in the intervention vs. comparison site.

ConclusionsSensitivity and bias analysis can shed light on why results of mathematical models and empirical epidemiologic studies differ for the same research question, and in turn, can improve study and model design.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280870,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-10-13 00:00:00,10/13/2022,,Nimalan Arinaminpathy; Carrie Reed; Matthew Biggerstaff; Anna Nguyen; Tejas S.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",,,biorxiv;2021.07.01.450475,2.0,new results,2022-10-14 00:00:00,10/14/2022,,Chengkun Wang; Ravi K.

Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in agin, but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell specific Hmgcl deficient mice fed a high-fat diet.

We therefore sought to test if the effects of cell size on protein concentrations were also evident in single cell proteomics data. Using the relative concentrations of histone proteins to estimate a cells DNA-to-cell volume ratio, we found that cell size correlated with the cell-to-cell variance in two single cell proteome datasets, each acquired using different preparation and measurement platforms. Moreover, the proteome differences between small and large single cells significantly correlated with how cell size affects the proteomes of cultured cells measured in bulk.

In addition, we propose aMarkov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministicalgorithms in the hard regime.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09986,arXiv:2210.09986v1,,,10/18/2022,10/18/2022,,L.

Different subsets of YAP target genes are engaged in each physiological setting, but how YAP selectively regulates different effectors in different contexts is not known. Here we use optogenetics to investigate how the levels and dynamics of YAP activation control its pluripotency effectors Oct4 and Nanog. We observe different thresholds for repression of Oct4 and Nanog, enabling differential control of both genes through YAP levels. Pluripotency factors also decode YAP dynamics. Oct4 preferentially responds to oscillatory YAP inputs that mimic endogenous pulsatile YAP dynamics. Using single-cell live imaging of Oct4 transcription and computational-theoretical analysis of transcriptional regulation, we demonstrate that YAP dynamics are decoded by an adaptive change sensor that modulates Oct4 transcription burst frequency. Our results reveal how the levels and timing of YAP activation enable multiplexing of information transmission for key regulators of cellular differentiation and pluripotency.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.17.512504,2.0,new results,2022-10-18 00:00:00,10/18/2022,,Kirstin Meyer; Nicholas C.

Breeding corals in aquaria are critical advances for population management, particularly genetic rescue and assisted gene flow efforts. Genetic rescue projects for corals are already underway to bring threatened species into ex situ culture and propagation, thereby preserving standing genetic variation. However, while breeding corals is increasingly feasible, the consequences of the aquarium environment on the genetic and phenotypic composition of coral populations is not yet known. The aquarium environment may in itself be a selective pressure on corals, but it also presents relaxed selective pressure in other respects. In 2019 and 2020, gravid Acropora hyacinthus coral colonies were collected from Palauan reefs and shipped to the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) in San Francisco. In both years, gametes were batch-fertilized to produce larvae that were then settled and reared to recruits. As of April 2021, when they were sampled for sequencing, 23 corals produced at CAS in 2019 and 16 corals produced at CAS in 2020 had survived for two years and one year, respectively. We sequenced the full genomes of the 39 offspring corals and their 15 potential parents to a median 26x depth of coverage. We find clear differential parentage, with some parents producing the vast majority of offspring, while the majority of parents produced no surviving offspring. After scanning 12.9 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we found 887 SNPs that may be under selection in the aquarium environment, and we identified the genes and pathways these SNPs may affect.

Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, also show diurnal rhythmicity in regulating local immune responses and synaptic remodeling. To investigate the interaction between aging and microglial circadian rhythmicity, we examined mice deficient in the core clock transcription factor, BMAL1. Aging Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice demonstrated accelerated cognitive decline in association with suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation and increases in immature dendritic spines. C1q deposition at synapses and synaptic engulfment were significantly decreased in aging Bmal1-deficient microglia, suggesting that BMAL1 plays a role in regulating synaptic pruning in aging. In addition to accelerated age-associated hippocampal deficits, Cd11bcre;Bmallox/lox mice also showed deficits in the sleep-wake cycle with increased wakefulness across light and dark phases. These results highlight an essential role of microglial BMAL1 in maintenance of synapse homeostasis in the aging brain.

Significance StatementThis study demonstrates that myeloid deficiency of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 disrupts microglial synaptic pruning in the hippocampus, accelerates age-associated cognitive decline, and disrupts the sleep-wake cycle.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.17.512618,2.0,new results,2022-10-22 00:00:00,10/22/2022,,Chinyere Agbaegbu Iweka; Erica Seigneur; Amira Latif Hernandez; Sur Herrera Paredes; Mica Cabrera; Eran Blacher; Connie Tsai Pasternak; Frank M.

Here, we show that increasing the local concentration of MPER-directed bnAbs at the cell surface via binding to the high affinity Fc receptor (Fc{gamma}RI) potentiates their ability to prevent viral entry in a manner analogous to the previously reported observation whereby the lipid binding activity of MPER bnAbs increases their concentration at the viral surface membrane. However, binding of MPER-directed bnAb 10E8 to Fc{gamma}RI abolishes the neutralization synergy that is seen with the N-heptad repeat (NHR)-targeting antibody D5_AR and NHR-targeting small molecule enfuvirtide (T20), possibly due to decreased accessibility of the NHR in the Fc{gamma}RI-10E8-MPER complex. Taken together, our results suggest that lipid-binding activity and Fc{gamma}RI-mediated potentiation function in concert to improve the potency of MPER-directed bnAbs by increasing their local concentration near the site of viral fusion. Therefore, lipid-binding may not be a strict requirement for potent neutralization by MPER-targeting bnAbs, as alternative methods can achieve similar increase in local concentration while avoiding potential liabilities associated with immunologic host tolerance.

Author summaryThe trimeric glycoprotein Env is the only viral protein expressed on the surface of HIV-1, is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies, and is the focus of most vaccine development efforts. Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of Env show lipid-binding characteristics and modulating this interaction affects neutralization. In this study, we tested the neutralization potencies of variants of the MPER-targeting antibody 10E8 with different viral membrane-binding and host Fc{gamma}RI-binding capabilities. Our results suggest that binding to both lipid and Fc{gamma}RI improves the neutralization potency of MPER-directed antibodies by concentrating the antibody at sites of viral fusion. As such, lipid-binding may not be uniquely required for MPER-targeting broadly neutralizing antibodies, as alternative methods to increase local concentration can achieve similar improvements in potency.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.23.513422,1.0,new results,2022-10-23 00:00:00,10/23/2022,,Soohyun Kim; Maria V.

Microbial enrichments to obtain novel isolates with slower growth rates or physiologies adapted to low nutrient environments are plagued by intrinsic biases for fastest-growing species when using standard laboratory isolation protocols. New cultivation tools to minimize these biases and enrich for less well-studied taxa are needed. In this study, we developed a high-throughput bacterial enrichment platform based on single cell encapsulation and growth within double emulsions (GrowMiDE). We showed that GrowMiDE can cultivate many different microorganisms and enrich for novel taxa that are never observed in traditional batch enrichments. For example, preventing dominance of the enrichment by fast-growing microbes due to nutrient privatization within the double emulsion droplets allowed cultivation of novel Negativicutes and Methanobacteria from stool samples in rich media enrichment cultures. In competition experiments between growth rate and growth yield specialist strains, GrowMiDE enrichments prevented competition for shared nutrient pools and enriched for slower-growing but more efficient strains. Finally, we demonstrated the compatibility of GrowMiDE with commercial fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain isolates from GrowMiDE enrichments. Together, GrowMiDE + DE-FACS is a promising new high-throughput enrichment platform that can be easily applied to diverse microbial enrichments or screens.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.23.513397,1.0,new results,2022-10-23 00:00:00,10/23/2022,,Alexandra L.

Intense interest since rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 has advanced our understanding of clinical outcomes after infection disrupts key processes of fetal neurodevelopment. Yet it is still largely unknown which cell types in the developing brain are targeted. We show that in human brain slices, rubella virus predominantly infects microglia. This infection occurs in a heterogeneous population but not in a highly microglia-enriched monoculture in the absence of other cell types.

We describe here a general approach to select and identify epitope-directed antibodies using a differential phage selection strategy. Prior to positive selection against protein of interest (POI), any binders that bind to undesired epitopes are depleted from the Fab phage library by a POI mutant with epitope of interest (EOI) mutated or blocked. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully developed highly specific antibodies targeting the proteolytic site on the CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) to block its proteolysis. We also generated antibodies recognizing the junction between the prodomain and catalytic domain of Matrix Metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) to block its maturation. Different from traditional MMP inhibitors targeting catalytic site, these potent MMP9 inhibitory antibodies are a novel class of MMP inhibitors with improved selectivity and stability. The inhibiting mechanism is unique among inhibitory antibodies and represents a new approach for developing molecules that inhibit therapeutic targets. These antibodies have shown promise in blocking metastasis of an invasive breast cancer cell line and are invaluable tools to assist the identification of MMP9 substrates by proteomics. We demonstrated the generality and versability of this approach by developing binders that block proteolytic activation of diverse protein targets with very distinct shapes and biological roles, including three MMPs (i.e., MMP1, MMP3, MMP10) and a cell surface receptor EPH Receptor A2 (EphA2).

While considerable progress has been made towards identifying the gut bacterial genes and enzymes involved, the role of environmental factors in shaping their activity remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the gut bacterial reduction of azo bonds (R-N=N-R), found in diverse chemicals in both food and drugs. Surprisingly, the canonical azoR gene in Escherichia coli was dispensable for azo bond reduction. Instead, azo reductase activity was controlled by the fumarate and nitrate reduction (fnr) regulator, consistent with a requirement for the anoxic conditions found within the gastrointestinal tract. Paired transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the fnr regulon revealed that in addition to altering the expression of multiple reductases, FNR is necessary for the metabolism of L-Cysteine to hydrogen sulfide, enabling the degradation of azo bonds. Taken together, these results show how gut bacteria sense and respond to their intestinal environment to enable the metabolism of chemical motifs found in both dietary and pharmaceutical compounds.

IMPORTANCEThis work has broad relevance due to the ubiquity of dyes containing azo bonds in food and drugs. We report that azo dyes can be degraded by human gut bacteria through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms, even from a single gut bacterial species. Furthermore, we revealed that environmental factors, oxygen and cysteine, control the ability of E. coli to degrade azo dyes due to their impacts on bacterial transcription and metabolism. These results open up new opportunities to manipulate the azoreductase activity of the gut microbiome through the manipulation of host diet, suggest that azoreductase potential may be altered in patients suffering from gastrointestinal disease, and highlight the importance of studying bacterial enzymes for drug metabolism in their natural cellular and ecological context.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.25.513779,1.0,new results,2022-10-25 00:00:00,10/25/2022,,Lindsey M.

This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering. The application of CRISPR technology to edit the non-coding genome, modulate gene regulation, make precise genetic changes and target infectious diseases has the potential to lead to curative therapies for many previously untreatable diseases.",,,,,,10/26/2022,2022/10/24,2022/10/26,Michael Chavez; Xinyi Chen; Paul B Finn; Lei S Qi,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.","Michael Chavez: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Xinyi Chen: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Paul B Finn: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Lei S Qi: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.",,,,,,1

Further, these studies link localization to RNA isoform expression, especially 3 Untranslated Region (UTR) regulation. The recent introduction of genome-wide spatial transcriptomics techniques enable the potential to test if subcellular localization is regulated in situ pervasively. In order to do this, robust statistical measures of subcellular localization and alternative poly-adenylation (APA) at single cell resolution are needed. Developing a new statistical framework called SPRAWL, we detect extensive cell-type specific subcellular RNA localization regulation in the mouse brain and to a lesser extent mouse liver. We integrated SPRAWL with a new approach to measure cell-type specific regulation of alternative 3 UTR processing and detected examples of significant correlations between 3 UTR length and subcellular localization. Included examples, Timp3, Slc32a1, Cxcl14, and Nxph1 have subcellular localization in the brain highly correlated with regulated 3 UTR processing that includes use of unannotated, but highly conserved, 3 ends. Together, SPRAWL provides a statistical framework to integrate multi-omic single-cell resolved measurements of gene-isoform pairs to prioritize an otherwise impossibly large list of candidate functional 3 UTRs for functional prediction and study. SPRAWL predicts 3 UTR regulation of subcellular localization may be more pervasive than currently known.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.26.513902,1.0,new results,2022-10-27 00:00:00,10/27/2022,,Rob Bierman; Julia Salzman,"Bierman, R.; Salzman, J.",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Rob Bierman, Stanford University], [Julia Salzman, Stanford University",,,,,,0

How neurons become excitable during development, and whether excitability is an intrinsic property of neurons or requires signaling from glial cells, remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that Schwann cells, the most abundant glia in the peripheral nervous system, promote somatosensory neuron excitability during development. We find that Schwann cells secrete prostaglandin E2, which is necessary and sufficient to induce somatosensory neurons to express normal levels of voltage-gated sodium channels and fire action potential trains. Inactivating this signaling pathway specifically in Schwann cells selectively impairs nociceptor and proprioceptor somatosensory neuron subtypes, leading to corresponding sensory defects in thermoception, inflammatory pain, and proprioception. Our studies thus reveal a cell non-autonomous mechanism by which glia regulate neuronal excitability to enable the development of normal sensory functions.

In cancer, this compartment is critical not only for defining tumor biology but also serves as a rich source of potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Recently, we profiled the surfaceome of the blood cancer multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell malignancy. While available small molecule agents can drive initial remissions in myeloma, resistance inevitably occurs. Several new classes of immunotherapies targeting myeloma surface antigens, including antibody therapeutics and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, can further prolong survival. However, new approaches are still needed for those who relapse. We thus applied the glycoprotein cell surface capture (CSC) methodology to panel of multiple myeloma cell lines, identifying key surface protein features of malignant plasma cells. We characterized the most abundant surface proteins on plasma cells, nominating CD48 as a high-density antigen favorable for a possible avidity-based strategy to enhance CAR-T efficacy. After chronic resistance to proteasome inhibitors, a first-line therapy, we found significant alterations in the surface profile of myeloma cells, including down-regulation of CD50, CD361/EVI2B, and CD53, while resistance to another first-line therapy, lenalidomide, drove increases in CD33 and CD45/PTPRC. In contrast, short-term treatment with lenalidomide led to upregulation of the surface antigen MUC-1, thereby enhancing efficacy of MUC-1 targeting CAR-T cells. Integrating our proteomics data with available transcriptome datasets, we developed a scoring system to rank potential standalone immunotherapy targets. Novel targets of interest included CCR10, TXNDC11, and LILRB4. We developed proof-of-principle CAR-T cells versus CCR10 using its natural ligand, CCL27, as an antigen recognition domain. Finally, we developed a ""miniaturized"" version of the CSC methodology and applied it to primary myeloma patient specimens. Overall, our work creates a unique resource for the myeloma community. This study also supports unbiased surface proteomic profiling as a fruitful strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets and markers of drug resistance, that could have utility in improving myeloma patient outcomes.

However, without quantitatively determining their parameters, it is unclear whether the plethora of positive autoregulatory modules found within developmental gene regulatory networks are actually bistable. Here, we combine in vivo live imaging with mathematical modeling to dissect the binary cell fate dynamics of the fruit fly pair-rule gene fushi tarazu (ftz), which is regulated by two known enhancers: the early (non-autoregulating) element and the autoregulatory element. Live imaging of transcription and protein concentration in the blastoderm revealed that binary Ftz cell states are achieved as ftz expression rapidly transitions from being dictated by the early element to the autoregulatory element. Moreover, we discovered that Ftz concentration alone is insufficient to activate the autoregulatory element, and that this element only becomes responsive to Ftz at a prescribed developmental time. Based on these observations, we developed a dynamical systems model, and quantitated its kinetic parameters directly from experimental measurements. Our model demonstrated that the ftz autoregulatory module is indeed bistable and that the early element transiently establishes the content of the binary cell fate decision to which the autoregulatory module then commits. Further analysis in silico revealed that the autoregulatory element locks the Ftz expression fate quickly, within 35 min of exposure to the transient signal of the early element. Overall, our work confirms the widely held hypothesis that autoregulation can establish developmental fates through bistability and, most importantly, provides a framework for the quantitative dissection of cellular decision-making based on systems dynamics models and real-time measurements of transcriptional and protein dynamics.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.31.514335,1.0,new results,2022-11-01 00:00:00,11/01/2022,,Jiaxi Zhao; Mindy Liu Perkins; Matthew Norstad; Hernan G.

Cell yield, aggregate morphology, and pluripotency marker expression are maintained over three serial passages in two distinct cell lines. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the same optimized parameters can be scaled to an automated 1 L stirred tank bioreactor system.

Gasdermin (GSDM) proteins are executioner pore-forming molecules that mediate cell death, yet their roles in the central nervous system (CNS) are not well understood. Here, we find that one GSDM family member, GSDME is expressed by both mouse and human neurons. GSDME plays a role in mitochondrial damage and axon loss. Mitochondrial neurotoxins induced caspase-dependent GSDME cleavage and rapid localization to mitochondria in axons, where GSDME promoted mitochondrial depolarization, trafficking defects, and neurite retraction. The frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated proteins TDP-43 and PR-50 induced GSDME-mediated damage to mitochondria and neurite loss. GSDME deficiency prolonged survival, ameliorated motor dysfunction, and rescued motor neuron loss in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. GSDME knockdown also protected against neurite loss in ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons. Thus, we identify GSDME as an executioner of neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to neurodegeneration.

Pathological transformation of astrocytes to reactive states can be protective or harmful to BBB function. Here, using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB co-culture model, we show that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transitions astrocytes to an inflammatory reactive state that causes BBB dysfunction through activation of STAT3 and increased expression of SERPINA3, which encodes alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (α1ACT). To contextualize these findings, we correlated astrocytic STAT3 activation to vascular inflammation in postmortem human tissue. Further, in murine brain organotypic cultures, astrocyte-specific silencing of Serpina3n reduced vascular inflammation after TNF challenge. Last, treatment with recombinant Serpina3n in both ex vivo explant cultures and in vivo was sufficient to induce BBB dysfunction-related molecular changes.

As predicted by catalytic models invoking transition state complementary, mutations to active site and active site-contacting residues had highly similar impacts on catalysis and TSA binding. Unexpectedly, most mutations to more distal residues which reduced catalysis had little or no impact on TSA binding and many even increased affinity for tungstate. These disparate effects are accounted for by a model in which distal mutations alter the enzymes conformational landscape and increase occupancy of microstates that are catalytically less effective but better able to accommodate larger transition state analogs. In support of this model, glycine substitutions (rather than valine) were more likely to increase tungstate affinity, presumably due to increased conformational flexibility and increased occupancy of previously disfavored microstates. These results indicate that residues throughout an enzyme provide specificity for the transition state and discriminate against analogs that are larger only by tenths of an [A]ngstrom. Thus, engineering enzymes that rival the most powerful natural enzymes will likely require consideration not just of residues in and around the active site, but also of more distal residues that shape the enzymes conformational landscape and finetune the active site. In addition, the extensive functional communication between the active site and remote residues may provide interconnections needed for allostery and make allostery a highly evolvable trait.

Significance StatementTransition state analogs (TSAs) resemble fleeting high-energy transition states and have been used to inhibit enzymes in nature and medicine, to learn about enzyme active site features, and to design and select new enzymes. While TSAs mimic transition states, they differ from actual TSs, and we exploit these differences here. Systematic TSA affinity measurements for 1,004 mutants of PafA (a model phosphatase enzyme) revealed effects in and around the active site that mirror their effects on catalysis, but TSA-binding and catalytic effects diverge more distally. These observations suggest that residues throughout an enzyme adjust its conformational landscape on the tenth-[A]ngstrom scale to optimize the active site for catalysis, rendering allostery more evolvable in nature but likely complicating enzyme design.",,,biorxiv;2022.11.07.515533,1.0,new results,2022-11-08 00:00:00,11/08/2022,,C.J.

While extensively profiled in the tumor microenvironment (TME), recent studies in mice identified responses in lymph nodes (LN) as essential; however, the role of LN in human cancer patients remains unknown. We examined CD8+ T cells in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, regional LN, and blood using mass cytometry, single-cell genomics, and multiplexed ion beam imaging. We identified progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex) that were abundant in uninvolved LN and clonally related to terminally exhausted cells in the TME. After anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, Tpex in uninvolved LN reduced in frequency but localized near dendritic cells and proliferating intermediate-exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex-int), consistent with activation and differentiation. LN responses coincided with increased circulating Tex-int. In metastatic LN, these response hallmarks were impaired by immunosuppressive cellular niches.

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PO_SCPLOWROSITEC_SCPLOW database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites. These methods demonstrate that COLLAPSE is computationally efficient, tunable, and interpretable, providing a general-purpose platform for computational protein analysis.",,,biorxiv;2022.07.20.500713,2.0,new results,2022-11-08 00:00:00,11/08/2022,,Alexander Derry; Russ B.

This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,138 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes. A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer pathology, accounting for the effect of APOE{varepsilon}4, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies.

In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al., 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.",cell biology; chromosome segregation; coarse-grained modeling; mechanics; microtubules; p. tridactylis; physics of living systems; spindle,,,,,2022-11-09 00:00:00,2022/11/08,2022/11/9,Pooja Suresh; Vahe Galstyan; Rob Phillips; Sophie Dumont,,"Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics Option, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States.; A.

During a bloodmeal, Bb migrates from the tick midgut to the salivary glands and changes its gene expression, priming Bb for vertebrate infection. These tick-specific transmission events are dependent on key transcriptional regulators; however, the full range of transcriptional changes that occur over several days inside of the tick are technically challenging to capture. We developed an experimental approach to enrich Bb cells from Ixodes ticks during a transmitting bloodmeal to longitudinally define their global transcriptomic landscape. We identified 192 genes that substantially change expression over the course of the tick bloodmeal, most of which were located on plasmids of the Bb genome. The majority of upregulated genes encode proteins found at the cell envelope or proteins of unknown function, including 45 outer surface lipoproteins embedded in the unusual protein-rich coat of Bb. As these proteins may facilitate Bb interactions with host tissues or immune systems, we also utilized mass spectrometry to identify candidate tick proteins that physically associate with Bb.

A full characterization of SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms counteracting antibody-mediated immunity is needed. Here, we report that ORF8 is a SARS-CoV-2 factor that controls cellular Spike antigen levels. ORF8 limits the availability of mature Spike by inhibiting host protein synthesis and retaining Spike at the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing cell-surface Spike levels and recognition by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. With limited Spike availability, ORF8 restricts Spike incorporation during viral assembly, reducing Spike levels in virions. Cell entry of these virions leaves fewer Spike molecules at the cell surface, limiting antibody recognition of infected cells.

Here, we introduce ""CAR Pooling,"" a multiplexed approach to rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells. CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism. BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic transcriptional signature previously associated with positive clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain in a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. Together, these results show that CAR Pooling is a general approach for rapid exploration of CAR architecture and activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies.",,,,,,2022-11-10 00:00:00,2022/11/09,2022/11/10,Daniel B Goodman;

Our data suggest that this biophysical defect leads to cell-cycle arrest, shutdown of Pol I-mediated transcription, and ultimately cell death. We propose that instead of targeting a single molecule, oxaliplatin preferentially partitions into nucleoli, where it modifies nucleolar RNA and proteins.

Driven by a quantum shift in the volume of high throughput data and in ready availability of data-intensive technologies, mathematical and quantitative approaches have become increasingly common in bioscience. For instance, a recent shift towards a quantitative description of cells and phenotypes, which is supplanting conventional qualitative descriptions, has generated immense promise and opportunities in the field of bench-to-bedside cancer OMICS, chemical biology and pharmacology. Nevertheless, like any burgeoning field, there remains a lack of shared and standardized framework for quantitative cancer research. Here, in the context of cancer, we present a basic framework and guidelines for bench-to-bedside quantitative research and therapy.

Here, we identified a gene program, defined by correlation with EN-RAGE (S100A12) gene expression, which was up-regulated in airway and blood myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients. The EN-RAGE program was expressed in 7 cohorts and observed in patients with both COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from other causes. This program was associated with greater clinical severity and predicted future mechanical ventilation and death. EN-RAGE+ myeloid cells express features consistent with suppressor cell functionality, with low HLA-DR and high PD-L1 surface expression and higher expression of T cell-suppressive genes. Sustained EN-RAGE signature expression in airway and blood myeloid cells correlated with clinical severity and increasing expression of T cell exhaustion markers, such as PD-1. IL-6 treatment of monocytes in vitro upregulated many of the severity-associated genes in the EN-RAGE gene program, along with potential mediators of T cell suppression, such as IL-10. Blockade of IL-6 signaling by tocilizumab in a placebo-controlled clinical trial led to a rapid normalization of ENRAGE and T cell gene expression. This identifies IL-6 as a key driver of myeloid dysregulation associated with worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients and provides insights into shared pathophysiological mechanisms in non-COVID-19 ARDS.",,,medrxiv;2022.11.07.22282049,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-11-13 00:00:00,11/13/2022,,Jason A.

CVDs and their metabolic risk factors have historically been concentrated among urban residents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) in LMICs such as India. However, as India develops, it is unclear whether these socioeconomic and geographic gradients will persist or change. Understanding these social dynamics in CVD risk is essential for mitigating the rising burden of CVDs and to reach those with the greatest needs.

MethodsUsing nationally representative data with biomarker measurements from the fourth (2015-16) and fifth (2019-21) Indian National Family and Health Surveys, we investigated trends in the prevalence of four CVD risk factors: tobacco consumption (self-reported, any type), unhealthy weight [Formula], idiabetes (random plasma glucose concentration [&ge;]200mg/dL or self-reported diabetes), and hypertension (one of: average systolic blood pressure [&ge;] 140mmHg, average diastolic blood pressure [&ge;] 90mmHg, self-reported past diagnosis, or self-reported current antihypertensive medication use) among adults aged 15-49 years. We first described changes at the national level and then trends stratified by place of residence (urban versus rural), geographic region (northern, northeastern, central, eastern, western, southern), regional level of development (Empowered Action Group member state or not), and two measures of socioeconomic status: level of education (no education, primary incomplete, primary complete, secondary incomplete, secondary complete, higher) and wealth (quintiles).

FindingsUnhealthy weight increased among all social and geographic groups but both the absolute and the relative changes were substantially higher among people with low SES (as measured by education or wealth) and in rural areas. For diabetes and hypertension, the prevalence increased for those from disadvantaged groups while staying constant or even decreasing among the wealthier and more educated. In contrast, tobacco consumption declined for all social and geographic groups.

InterpretationIn 2015-16, CVD risk factors were higher among more advantaged subpopulations in India. However, between 2015-16 and 2019-21, the prevalence of these risk factors grew more rapidly for less wealthy and less educated subpopulations and those living in rural areas. These trends have resulted in CVD risk becoming far more widespread throughout the population; CVD can no longer be characterized as a wealthy urban phenomenon.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for work published between Jan 1, 1990, and Sep 23, 2022, with variations of the search terms ""reversal hypothesis"", ""social gradient"", ""socioeconomic gradient"", ""social difference"", ""socioeconomic difference"", ""socioeconomic status"", ""change"", ""trend"", ""cardiovascular disease"", ""cardiovascular risk factor"", ""diabetes"", ""hypertension"", ""overweight"", ""obesity"", ""smoking"", ""tobacco"", ""low-income"", ""lower-middle-income"", and ""India"" in the title or abstract. Existing studies on changes in the socioeconomic patterning of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors mostly compared the size of social gradients in obesity cross-sectionally between countries at different levels of national income or development. These studies generally found higher obesity among higher socioeconomic status (SES) populations but opposite gradients for countries at higher levels of development. However, because these studies use cross-sectional comparisons, whether these patterns reflect the influence of development or other contextual factors associated with countries at different levels of development is unclear. Both for obesity and for other CVD risk factors, we found few nationally-representative studies that traced how gradients within countries changed over time as they developed. Importantly, most of these studies did not focus on India and those that did only considered single risk factors such as obesity using older data. Existing nationally representative research on India is thus predominantly cross-sectional and has only focused on the size of social gradients at single points in time. This work generally finds higher levels of unhealthy weight, diabetes, and hypertension among wealthy and educated subpopulations but lower levels of tobacco consumption. Subnational and smaller non-representative studies from India that traced changes in CVD risk factors over time provide some evidence of reversing or flattening gradients but it is unclear whether these patterns hold at regional and national levels.

Added value of this studyUsing data from the 2015-16 and 2019-2021 National Family and Health Surveys, we provide some of the first nationally representative evidence for trends in the prevalence of major CVD risk factors in India and how these trends have changed across social and geographic groups. Both absolute and relative increases in prevalence were far more pronounced among relatively poor and less educated populations. As a result of these trends, most CVD risk factors became more equal across population groups, or in some cases, became higher among the less compared to more educated.

Implications of all the available evidenceIndians with lower SES - as measured by wealth and education - experienced considerable adverse trends in unhealthy weight, diabetes, and hypertension between 2015-16 and 2019-21. Our results reveal that CVDs can no longer be considered a problem of the affluent parts of society and suggest that CVD prevention efforts that reach less advantaged subpopulations are urgently needed.",,,medrxiv;2022.11.11.22282234,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-11-13 00:00:00,11/13/2022,,Sarah Wetzel; Pascal Geldsetzer; Sneha Sarah Mani; Aashish Gupta; Kavita Singh; Mohammed K.

This study resolves the neighborhood relationship of protein-coding genes through uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of high-quality gene expression data. The resultant transcriptome image is conducive to classification tasks and generative learning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with full or partial transcriptome images differentiate normal versus lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and LUSC versus lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with over 96% accuracy, comparable to XGBoost. Meanwhile, the generative adversarial network (GAN) model trained with 93 TcgaTargetGtex transcriptome classes synthesizes highly realistic and diverse tissue/cancer-specific transcriptome images. Comparative analysis of GAN-synthesized LUSC and LUAD transcriptome images show selective retention and enhancement of epithelial identity gene expression in the LUSC transcriptome. Further analyses of synthetic LUSC transcriptomes identify a novel role for mitochondria electron transport complex I expression in LUSC stratification and prognosis. In summary, this study provides an intuitive transcriptome embedding compatible with generative deep learning and realistic transcriptome synthesis.

Significance StatementDeep learning is most successful when the subject is structured. This study provides a novel way of converting unstructured gene expression lists to 2D-structured transcriptome portraits that are intuitive and compatible with a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based deep learning. The StyleGAN generator trained with transcriptome portrait libraries synthesizes tissue- and disease-specific transcriptomes with significant diversity. Detailed analyses of the synthetic transcriptomes reveal selective enhancement of clinically significant features not apparent in the original transcriptome.

The controlled expression of one cellular feature - the cilium - was likely critical during early animal evolution. Two key transcription factors, RFX and FoxJ1, coordinate ciliogenesis in animals but are absent from the genomes of most other ciliated eukaryotes, raising the question of how the transcriptional regulation of ciliogenesis has evolved. To reconstruct the evolution of the RFX/FoxJ1 transcriptional module and its role in the regulation of ciliogenesis, we investigated RFX and FoxJ1 function in one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. Targeted disruption of the S. rosetta RFX homolog cRFXa resulted in delayed cell proliferation and aberrant ciliogenesis, marked by the collapse and resorption of nascent cilia. Ciliogenesis genes and foxJ1 were significantly down-regulated in cRFXa mutants, consistent with a pre-animal ancestry for this transcriptional module. We also found that cRFXa protein preferentially binds to a sequence motif that is enriched in the promoters of S. rosetta ciliary genes and matches the sequence motif bound by animal RFX proteins. These findings suggest that RFX coordinated ciliogenesis before the divergence of animals and choanoflagellates, and that the deployment of this module may have provided a mechanism to differentiate ciliated and non-ciliated cell types in early animal evolution.",,,biorxiv;2022.11.11.515474,1.0,new results,2022-11-14 00:00:00,11/14/2022,,Maxwell C.

The SC ensures the formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes and also regulates their distribution. However, how the SC regulates crossover formation remains elusive. We isolated an unusual mutation in C. elegans that disrupts crossover interference but not the assembly of the SC. This mutation alters the unique C-terminal domain of an essential SC protein, SYP-4, a likely ortholog of the vertebrate SC protein SIX6OS1. To characterize the structure of the SC in wild-type and mutant animals, we use three-dimensional STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (3D-STORM) to interrogate the molecular architecture of the SC in intact germline tissue from C. elegans. The approach enabled us to define positions of protein epitopes with respect to the 3D architecture of this complex. Using a probabilistic mapping approach to analyze super-resolution image data, we detect a marked structural transition in wild-type animals that coincides with crossover designation. We also found that our syp-4 mutant subtly perturbs SC architecture. Our findings add to growing evidence that the SC is an active material whose molecular organization contributes to chromosome-wide crossover regulation.",,,biorxiv;2020.02.16.947804,2.0,new results,2022-11-14 00:00:00,11/14/2022,,Simone Köhler; Michal Wojcik; Ke Xu; Abby F.

We thus systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central for studies published between January 2007 and October 2019 involving technologies that were mobile phone- or tablet-based; able to screen for, diagnose, or monitor a communicable disease of importance in LMICs; and targeted health professionals as primary users. We excluded technologies that merely digitized existing paper-based tools or simply facilitated communication. Extracted data included disease category, pathogen type, diagnostic method, intervention purpose, study/target population, sample size, study methodology, development stage, accessory requirement, country of development, operating system, and cost. Given the search timeline and the extremely rapid turnover in the science concerning Coronavirus Disease 2019 and its novel variants, studies involving it were not included in the analysis.

Of 13,262 studies identified by the screen, 33 met inclusion criteria. 12% were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), with 58% of publications representing technical descriptions. 62% of studies had 100 or fewer subjects. All studied technologies involved diagnosis or screening steps; none addressed the monitoring of infections. 52% focused on priority diseases (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis), but only 12% addressed a neglected tropical disease. Although most reported studies were priced under 20USD at time of publication, two thirds of the records did not yet specify a cost for the study technology.

We conclude that there are only a small number of mHealth technologies focusing on innovative methods of screening and diagnosing communicable diseases potentially of use in LMICs. Rigorous RCTs, analyses with large sample size, and technologies assisting in the monitoring of diseases are needed.

Author SummaryAlthough significant progress has been made in decreasing their worldwide impact, infectious diseases still represent a considerable burden of disease and death. This is especially the case in certain regions of low- and middle-income countries, where limited healthcare resources, personnel, and facilities can make it difficult to provide high quality care. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are disruptive tools that hold considerable promise in these resource-constrained settings by circumventing some of the aforementioned obstacles.

To better understand the availability and characteristics of mHealth technologies for use in low- and middle-income countries, we systematically searched for studies published in English between January 2007 through October 2019 to identify all existing mobile phone- or tablet-based innovations targeted at healthcare providers for use against infectious diseases in these settings and summarized their qualities and performance.

We found that four times as many publications focused on tools that simply made data transfer more simple than there were on new tools for detecting or monitoring diseases. Few studies were tested under the most rigorous scientific methods. Many diagnostic technologies we identified require specialized attachments or additional laboratory equipment that connect to the smartphone or tablet, which could make their use in some settings more challenging.",,,medrxiv;2022.11.15.22282011,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-11-15 00:00:00,11/15/2022,,Pascal Geldsetzer; Sergio Flores; Blanca Flores; Abu Bakarr Rogers; Andrew Y Chang,"Geldsetzer, P.; Flores, S.; Flores, B.; Rogers, A.

Their host associations, metabolic capabilities, and potential roles in biogeochemical cycles remain under-explored. We studied chemoautotrophically-based biofilms that host diverse CPR bacteria and grow in sulfide-rich springs using bulk geochemical analysis, genome-resolved metagenomics and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) at room temperature and 87{degrees} K.

ResultsCPR-affiliated Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, Saccharibacteria, Peregrinibacteria, Berkelbacteria, Microgenomates, and Parcubacteria are members of two biofilm communities dominated by chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria including Thiothrix or Beggiatoa. STXM imaging revealed ultra-small cells along the surfaces of filamentous bacteria that we interpret are CPR bacterial episymbionts. STXM and NEXAFS spectroscopy at carbon K and sulfur L2,3 edges show protein-encapsulated elemental sulfur spherical granules associated with filamentous bacteria, indicating that they are sulfur-oxidizers, likely Thiothrix. Berkelbacteria and Moranbacteria in the same biofilm sample are predicted to have a novel electron bifurcating group 3b [NiFe]-hydrogenase, putatively a sulfhydrogenase, potentially linked to sulfur metabolism via redox cofactors. This complex could potentially underpin a symbiosis involving Berkelbacteria and/or Moranbacteria and filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria such as Thiothrix that is based on cryptic sulfur cycling. One Doudnabacteria genome encodes adjacent sulfur dioxygenase and rhodanese genes that may convert thiosulfate to sulfite. We find similar conserved genomic architecture associated with CPR bacteria from other sulfur-rich subsurface ecosystems.

ConclusionsOur combined metagenomic, geochemical, spectromicroscopic and structural bioinformatics analyses link some CPR bacteria to sulfur-oxidizing Proteobacteria, likely Thiothrix, and indicate roles for CPR bacteria in sulfur and hydrogen cycling.",,,biorxiv;2022.11.17.516901,1.0,new results,2022-11-17 00:00:00,11/17/2022,,Luis E.

The bacterial actin homolog MreB, which is essential for cell-shape determination in many rod-shaped bacteria, has served as a model system for studying the mechanics of cytoskeletal filaments. Previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the twist of MreB double protofilaments is dependent on the bound nucleotide, as well as binding to the membrane or the accessory protein RodZ, and MreB mutations that modulate twist also affect MreB spatial organization and cell shape. Here, we show that MreB double protofilaments can adopt multiple twist states during microsecond-scale MD simulations. A deep learning algorithm trained only on high- and low-twist states robustly identified all twist conformations across most perturbations of ATP-bound MreB, suggesting the existence of a conserved set of states whose occupancy is affected by each perturbation to MreB. Simulations replacing ATP with ADP indicated that twist states were generally stable after hydrolysis.

ObjectivesWe aimed to generalize the results of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh randomized controlled trial to other contexts or scenarios using a mechanistic disease transmission model and counterfactual simulations.

MethodsA disease transmission model was developed to account for transmission across multiple environmental pathways, multiple interventions (water (W), sanitation (S), hygiene (H), nutrition (N)) applied individually and in combination, adherence to interventions, and the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. Leveraging a set of mechanistic parameter combinations fit to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial (n=17,187) using a Bayesian sampling approach, we simulated trial outcomes under counterfactual scenarios to estimate how changes in intervention completeness, coverage, fidelity and adherence, and efficacy, as well as baseline WASH conditions and disease burden, impacted intervention effectiveness.

ResultsIncreasing community coverage was associated with the greatest impact on intervention effectiveness (e.g., 26{middle dot}9% and 52{middle dot}7% median increases in effectiveness in the WSH and WSHN intervention arms when increasing coverage to 20%). The effect of community coverage on effectiveness depended on intervention completeness, i.e., the fraction of transmission that was along pathways modified by the interventions. Intervention effectiveness was reduced in counterfactual simulations with lower levels of preexisting WASH conditions or increased baseline disease burden. Individual interventions had complementary but not synergistic effects when combined.

We combine experiment and simulation to design a crowding sensor based on this principle that provides a quantitative readout of cell surface crowding. Our measurements reveal that surface crowding decreases IgG antibody binding by 2-20 fold in live cells compared to a bare membrane surface, resulting in a cell surface osmotic pressure opposing binding of 1 - 4 kPa. Our sensors show that sialic acid, a negatively charged monosaccharide, contributes disproportionately to red blood cell surface crowding via electrostatic repulsion, despite occupying only ~1% of the total cell membrane by mass. We also observe significant differences in surface crowding for different cell types and find that expression of single oncogenes can both increase and decrease crowding, suggesting that surface crowding may be an indicator of both cell type and state. Our high-throughput, single-cell measurement of cell surface osmotic pressure may be combined with functional assays to enable further biophysical dissection of the cell surfaceome.

Significance StatementCells interact with each other and the extracellular environment through a crowded assembly of polymers on their plasma membranes. The high density of these surface polymers can generate physical crowding that impacts cell function. However, tools to quantify the extent and effect of surface crowding on live cell membranes are lacking. In this work, we design macromolecular sensors that act as direct reporters of cell surface crowding. We combine experiments on reconstituted and live cell surfaces with molecular dynamics simulations to provide a mechanistic understanding of how cell surface crowding reduces binding of soluble molecules, and we show that crowding varies significantly with cell type and is affected by oncogene expression.",,,biorxiv;2022.11.18.517164,1.0,new results,2022-11-20 00:00:00,11/20/2022,,Sho C.

The dysregulation of ceramide metabolism has been implicated in cancer evasion of apoptosis and targeting ceramide metabolism has potential therapeutic benefits as a strategy to kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth. However, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to ceramide-mediated cell death are vastly intertwined and incompletely understood. To shed light on this mystery, we performed a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify regulators of cancer resistance to the soluble short chain ceramide, C6 ceramide (C6-Cer). Our results reveal a complex landscape of genetic modifiers of C6-Cer toxicity, including genes associated with ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and membrane biology. Furthermore, we find that loss of the phospholipid flippase subunit TMEM30A impairs the plasma membrane trafficking of its binding partner, the P4-type ATPase ATP11B, and depletion of TMEM30A or ATP11B disrupts plasma membrane asymmetry and promotes resistance to C6-Cer toxicity.

For example, parabiosis and partial reprogramming through overexpressing four stem cell transcription factors (Yamanaka factors) both rejuvenate organisms and cells1-5. We hypothesize there are many other genetic solutions to human cell rejuvenation, and some solutions may be safer and more potent than current gene targets. We set out to develop a systematic approach to identify novel genes that, when overexpressed or repressed, reprogram the global gene expression of a cell back to a younger state. Using the Hayflick model of human cell replicative aging, we performed a Perturb-seq screen of 200 transcription factors (TFs) selected through a combination of bioinformatic analysis and literature search. We identified dozens of potentially rejuvenating TFs--those that when overexpressed or repressed in late passage cells reprogrammed global gene expression patterns back to an earlier passage state. We further validated four top TF perturbations through molecular phenotyping of various aging hallmarks. Late passage cells either overexpressing EZH2 or E2F3 or repressing STAT3 or ZFX had more cell division, less senescence, improved proteostasis, and enhanced mitochondrial function. These TF perturbations led to similar downstream gene expression programs. In addition, the rejuvenating effects of these TFs were independent of telomeres. We believe our general approach for identifying rejuvenating factors can be applied to other model systems, and some of the top TF perturbations we discovered will lead to future research in novel, safer rejuvenation therapies.",,,biorxiv;2022.11.20.517270,2.0,new results,2022-11-22 00:00:00,11/22/2022,,Janine Sengstack; Jiashun Zheng; Michael Mobaraki; Jue Lin; Changhui Deng; Hao Li,"Sengstack, J.; Zheng, J.; Mobaraki, M.; Lin, J.; Deng, C.; Li, H.","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Tetrad Graduate Program, University of California,; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Developmental and Stem Cell Biology Program, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California","Janine Sengstack, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, Tetrad Graduate Program, University of California,], [Jiashun Zheng, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California], [Michael Mobaraki, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, Developmental and Stem Cell Biology Program, University of California], [Jue Lin, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California], [Changhui Deng, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California], [Hao Li, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California",,,,,,0

We use chemical approaches to show that a [~]50 kDa plasma protein is the principal alkaloid binding molecule in blood from poison frogs.

In addition to alkaloid binding activity, ABG sequesters and regulates the bioavailability of ""free"" plasma alkaloids in vitro. Unexpectedly, ABG is not related to saxiphilin or albumin, but instead exhibits sequence and structural homology to mammalian hormone carriers and amphibian biliverdin binding proteins.

Zooids undergo a weekly cycle of regression and renewal during which mature zooids are replaced by developing buds. The zooid brain matures and degenerates on this 7-day cycle. We used focal extracellular recording and video imaging to explore brain activity in the context of development and degeneration and to examine the contributions of the nervous system and vascular network to behavior. Recordings from the brain revealed complex firing patterns arising both spontaneously and in response to stimulation. Neural activity increases as the brain matures and declines thereafter. Motor behavior follows the identical time course. The behavior of each zooid is guided predominantly by its individual brain, but sister zooids can also exhibit synchronous motor behavior. The vascular network also generates action potentials that are largely independent of neural activity. In addition, the entire vascular network undergoes slow rhythmic contractions that appear to arise from processes endogenous to vascular epithelial cells.

Using this assay, we tested 270 clinical samples and detected the introduction of Omicron BA.1/BA1.1 and BA.2 in the Santa Barbara County (SBC) population in December 2021 and February 2022, respectively. Identifying Omicron variants using this RT-qPCR assay showed complete concordance with whole viral genome sequencing; both assays indicated that Omicron was the dominant variant in SB County. Our data substantiate that RT-qPCR-based virus detection assays offer a fast and inexpensive alternative to NGS for virus variant-specific detection approach, which allows streamlining the detection of Omicron variants in patient samples.",NGS; SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology; molecular assay; omicron; public health; qPCR,,,,,2022-11-27 00:00:00,2022/11/15,2022/11/27,Zach Aralis; Stewart Comer; Henning Ansorg; Carl Palmer; Jennifer Smith; Stuart C Feinstein; Lynn N Fitzgibbons; Carolina Arias,,"California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Medical Education, Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Center for Stem Cell Biology and Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Infectious Disease Initiative, Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; LegacyWorks Group, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Pathology, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.","Zach Aralis: Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Stewart Comer: Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Pathology, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Henning Ansorg: Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Carl Palmer: LegacyWorks Group, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Jennifer Smith: California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Stuart C Feinstein: Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Lynn N Fitzgibbons: Department of Medical Education, Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.Carolina Arias: Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Center for Stem Cell Biology and Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.; Infectious Disease Initiative, Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA 93106, USA.",,,,,,0

Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization.

Conventional breeding approaches to increase grain mineral concentrations in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have had only limited success, and our understanding of the genetic and physiological barriers to altering this trait is incomplete. Here we demonstrate that a transgenic approach combining endosperm-specific expression of the wheat VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER gene TaVIT2-D with constitutive expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE gene OsNAS2 significantly increases the total concentration of zinc and relocates iron to white-flour fractions. In two distinct bread wheat cultivars, we show that the so called VIT-NAS construct led to a two-fold increase in zinc in wholemeal flour, to ∼50 µg g-1. Total iron was not significantly increased, but redistribution within the grain resulted in a three-fold increase in iron in highly pure, roller-milled white flour, to ∼25 µg g-1. Interestingly, expression of OsNAS2 partially restored iron translocation to the aleurone, which is iron depleted in grain overexpressing TaVIT2 alone. A greater than three-fold increase in the level of the natural plant metal chelator nicotianamine in the grain of VIT-NAS lines corresponded with improved iron and zinc bioaccessibility in white flour. The growth of VIT-NAS plants in the greenhouse was indistinguishable from untransformed controls.

Here, we report the role of MODIFIER OF SNC1, 4-ASSOCIATED COMPLEX SUBUNIT 5A (MAC5A) in DDR in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Lack of MAC5A in mac5a mutants causes hypersensitive phenotypes to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a DNA damage inducer. Consistent with this observation, MAC5A can regulate alternative splicing of DDR genes to maintain the proper response to genotoxic stress. Interestingly, MAC5A interacts with the 26S proteasome (26SP) and is required for its proteasome activity. MAC core subunits are also involved in MMS-induced DDR. Moreover, we find that MAC5A, the MAC core subunits, and 26SP may act collaboratively to mediate high-boron-induced growth repression through DDR.

Young TEs, particularly LINEs, drive increases in genome size while DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes.

Here we report intricate crosstalk among the 3 pathways, centered around the SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex of ERAD, in the regulation of organellar organization in β cells. SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD deficiency in β cells triggers activation of autophagy, at least in part, via IRE1α (an endogenous ERAD substrate). In the absence of functional SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, proinsulin is retained in the ER as high molecular weight conformers, which are subsequently cleared via ER-phagy. A combined loss of both SEL1L and autophagy in β cells leads to diabetes in mice shortly after weaning, with premature death by approximately 11 weeks of age, associated with marked ER retention of proinsulin and β cell loss. Using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy powered by deep-learning automated image segmentation and 3D reconstruction, our data demonstrate a profound organellar restructuring with a massive expansion of ER volume and network in β cells lacking both SEL1L and autophagy.

The participants were randomly assigned with 1:1 to receive a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 or BBIBP-CorV. The primary outcomes were immunogenicity and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant, and the exploratory outcome was cross-immunogenicity against other circulating strains. Between May 25 and 30, 2022, 516 adults received booster vaccination with 260 in NVSI-06-09 group and 256 in BBIBP-CorV group. Interim results showed a similar safety profile between two booster groups, with low incidence of adverse reactions of grade 1 or 2. For immunogenicity, by day 14 post-booster, the fold rises in neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) from baseline elicited by NVSI-06-09 were remarkably higher than those by BBIBP-CorV against the prototype strain (19.67 vs 4.47-fold), Omicron BA.1.1 (42.35 vs 3.78-fold), BA.2 (25.09 vs 2.91-fold), BA.4 (22.42 vs 2.69-fold), and BA.5 variants (27.06 vs 4.73-fold). Similarly, the neutralizing GMTs boosted by NVSI-06-09 against Beta and Delta variants were also 6.60-fold and 7.17-fold higher than those by BBIBP-CorV. Our findings indicated that a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 was well-tolerated and elicited broad-spectrum neutralizing responses against divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron and its sub-lineages.",,,,,,01/04/2023,2023/01/03,2023/1/4,Nawal Al Kaabi;

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS. These results open up new avenues for improving picoscale droplet RT-PCR reactions and expanding microfluidic droplet-based single-cell analysis technologies.",,,,,,01/05/2023,2023/01/04,2023/1/5,Margarita Khariton; Conor J McClune; Kara K Brower; Sandy Klemm; Elizabeth S Sattely; Polly M Fordyce; Bo Wang,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94110, United States.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.","Margarita Khariton: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Conor J McClune: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kara K Brower: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Sandy Klemm: Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Elizabeth S Sattely: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Polly M Fordyce: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94110, United States.Bo Wang: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.08.16.504154,20,1

In particular, ferroelastic property, for which the spontaneous strain can be transformed by applying mechanical stress, is very promising for extensive nanotechnological applications. However, integrating ferroelastic property into 2D OIHPs is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed two new 2D OIHPs (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M = Mn for 1 and Cd for 2), which undergo reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with an Aizu expression 4/mmmFmmm.

Inparticular, we analyze nearly 2,500 physical activity competitions over aperiod of one year capturing more than 800,000 person days of activitytracking. We observe that during walking competitions, the average userincreases physical activity by 23%. Furthermore, there are large increases inactivity for both men and women across all ages, and weight status, and evenfor users that were previously fairly inactive.

Furthermore, competitions with an equal mix of both men andwomen are more effective in increasing the level of activities.

In contrast to previous cyclemodeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered inmodeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete andcontinuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data;and they can share information across individuals to model variation bothwithin and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic andreal-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengthsmore accurately than existing methods, with 58% lower error on simulated dataand 63% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performingbaseline.

Thesecommunities can interact with one another, often leading to conflicts and toxicinteractions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of interactionsbetween communities and how they impact users. Here we study intercommunity interactions across 36,000 communities onReddit, examining cases where users of one community are mobilized by negativesentiment to comment in another community. We show that such conflicts tend tobe initiated by a handful of communities---less than 1% of communities start74% of conflicts. While conflicts tend to be initiated by highly activecommunity members, they are carried out by significantly less active members.We find that conflicts are marked by formation of echo chambers, where usersprimarily talk to other users from their own community. In the long-term,conflicts have adverse effects and reduce the overall activity of users in thetargeted communities. Our analysis of user interactions also suggests strategies for mitigating thenegative impact of conflicts---such as increasing direct engagement betweenattackers and defenders. Further, we accurately predict whether a conflict willoccur by creating a novel LSTM model that combines graph embeddings, user,community, and text features.

Here we provide an empirical studyon 34 proteins supporting the idea that allosteric conformational changegenerally occurs along a soft elastic mode presenting extended regions of highshear. We argue, based on a detailed analysis of how the energy profile alongsuch a mode depends on binding, that in the induced fit scenario there is anoptimal stiffness $k_a^*\sim 1/N$ for cooperative binding, where $N$ is thenumber of residues involved in the allosteric response. We find that thepopulation shift scenario is more robust to mutation affecting stiffness, asbinding becomes more and more cooperative with stiffness up to the samecharacteristic value $k_a^*$, beyond which cooperativity saturates instead ofdecaying. We confirm numerically these findings in a non-linear mechanicalmodel. Dynamical considerations suggest that a stiffness of order $k_a^*$ isfavorable in that scenario as well, supporting that for proper functionproteins must evolve a functional elastic mode that is softer as their sizeincreases.

When a company faces adverse publicity, theywould like to engage persuasive advocates for their position in the presence ofadversaries who are critical of them. Debates represent a common platform forthese forms of adversarial persuasion. This paper solves two problems: theDebate Outcome Prediction (DOP) problem predicts who wins a debate while theIntensity of Persuasion Prediction (IPP) problem predicts the change in thenumber of votes before and after a speaker speaks. Though DOP has beenpreviously studied, we are the first to study IPP. Past studies on DOP fail toleverage two important aspects of multimodal data: 1) multiple modalities areoften semantically aligned, and 2) different modalities may provide diverseinformation for prediction. Our M2P2 (Multimodal Persuasion Prediction)framework is the first to use multimodal (acoustic, visual, language) data tosolve the IPP problem. To leverage the alignment of different modalities whilemaintaining the diversity of the cues they provide, M2P2 devises a noveladaptive fusion learning framework which fuses embeddings obtained from twomodules -- an alignment module that extracts shared information betweenmodalities and a heterogeneity module that learns the weights of differentmodalities with guidance from three separately trained unimodal referencemodels.

StaDISCwas developed during our re-analysis of the 1999-2000 VIGOR study, an 8076patient randomized controlled trial (RCT), that compared the risk of adverseevents from a then newly approved drug, Rofecoxib (Vioxx), to that from anolder drug Naproxen. Vioxx was found to, on average and in comparison toNaproxen, reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) events but increase the riskof thrombotic cardiovascular (CVT) events. Applying StaDISC, we fit 18 popularconditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimators for both outcomes anduse calibration to demonstrate their poor global performance. However, they arelocally well-calibrated and stable, enabling the identification of patientgroups with larger than (estimated) average treatment effects. In fact, StaDISCdiscovers three clinically interpretable subgroups each for the GI outcome(totaling 29.4% of the study size) and the CVT outcome (totaling 11.0%).Complementary analyses of the found subgroups using the 2001-2004 APPROVestudy, a separate independently conducted RCT with 2587 patients, providesfurther supporting evidence for the promise of StaDISC.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10109,arXiv:2008.10109v2,,,08/23/2020,08/23/2020,,Raaz Dwivedi; Yan Shuo Tan; Briton Park; Mian Wei; Kevin Horgan; David Madigan; Bin Yu,,,,,,,,,1

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success ingraph representation learning. However, expressive power of GNNs is limited bythe 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and thus GNNs generate identicalrepresentations for graph substructures that may in fact be very different.More powerful GNNs, proposed recently by mimicking higher-order-WL tests, onlyfocus on representing entire graphs and they are computationally inefficient asthey cannot utilize sparsity of the underlying graph. Here we propose andmathematically analyze a general class of structure-related features, termedDistance Encoding (DE). DE assists GNNs in representing any set of nodes, whileproviding strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test. DE captures thedistance between the node set whose representation is to be learned and eachnode in the graph. To capture the distance DE can apply various graph-distancemeasures such as shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores. Wepropose two ways for GNNs to use DEs (1) as extra node features, and (2) ascontrollers of message aggregation in GNNs. Both approaches can utilize thesparse structure of the underlying graph, which leads to computationalefficiency and scalability. We also prove that DE can distinguish node setsembedded in almost all regular graphs where traditional GNNs always fail. Weevaluate DE on three tasks over six real networks: structural role prediction,link prediction, and triangle prediction. Results show that our modelsoutperform GNNs without DE by up-to 15\% in accuracy and AUROC.

However, their number density has not been welldetermined, making it difficult to assess their role in the early ionization ofthe intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we present the updated results ofour $z\sim5$ quasar survey using the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), anear-infrared imaging survey covering an area of 85 deg$^{2}$. From ourspectroscopic observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) onthe Gemini-South 8 m Telescope, we discovered eight new quasars at $z\sim5$with $-26.1\leq M_{1450} \leq -23.3$. Combining our IMS faint quasars($M_{1450}>-27$ mag) with the brighter Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars($M_{1450}<-27$ mag), we derive the $z\sim5$ quasar luminosity function (QLF)without any fixed parameters down to the magnitude limit of $M_{1450}=-23$ mag.We find that the faint-end slope of the QLF is very flat($\alpha=-1.2^{+1.4}_{-0.6}$), with a characteristic luminosity of$M^{*}_{1450}=-25.8^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ mag. The number density of $z\sim5$ quasarsfrom the QLF gives an ionizing emissivity at 912 $\unicode{x212B}$ of$\epsilon_{912}=(3.7$--$7.1)\times10^{23}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$and an ionizing photon density of $\dot{n}_{\rm ion}=(3.0$--$5.7)\times10^{49}$Mpc$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. These results imply that quasars are responsible for only10-20% (up to 50% even in the extreme case) of the photons required tocompletely ionize the IGM at $z\sim5$, disfavoring the idea that quasars alonecould have ionized the IGM at $z\sim5$.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05859,arXiv:2010.05859v1,,,10/12/2020,10/12/2020,,Yongjung Kim; Myungshin Im; Yiseul Jeon; Minjin Kim; Soojong Pak; Minhee Hyun; Yoon Chan Taak; Suhyun Shin; Gu Lim; Gregory S.

However, it has been anoutstanding challenge of how to handle arbitrary first-order logic (FOL)queries as present methods are limited to only a subset of FOL operators. Inparticular, the negation operator is not supported. An additional limitation ofpresent methods is also that they cannot naturally model uncertainty. Here, wepresent BetaE, a probabilistic embedding framework for answering arbitrary FOLqueries over KGs. BetaE is the first method that can handle a complete set offirst-order logical operations: conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$),and negation ($\neg$). A key insight of BetaE is to use probabilisticdistributions with bounded support, specifically the Beta distribution, andembed queries/entities as distributions, which as a consequence allows us toalso faithfully model uncertainty. Logical operations are performed in theembedding space by neural operators over the probabilistic embeddings. Wedemonstrate the performance of BetaE on answering arbitrary FOL queries onthree large, incomplete KGs.

However,theoretical studies into how tree-based methods discover Boolean featureinteractions are missing.

Specifically,the LSS model assumes that the regression function is a linear combination ofpiecewise constant Boolean interaction terms.

We prove that, with high probability,DWP(S) attains a universal upper bound that does not involve any modelcoefficients, if and only if S corresponds to a union of Boolean interactionsunder the LSS model. Consequentially, we show that a theoretically tractableversion of the iRF procedure, called LSSFind, yields consistent interactiondiscovery under the LSS model as the sample size goes to infinity.

However, it remainspoorly understood how the dynamic interplay of these components and the cellpolarity determine the emergent migration behavior at the cellular scale. Here,we combine data-driven inference with a mechanistic bottom-up approach todevelop a model for protrusion and polarity dynamics in confined cellmigration, revealing how the cellular dynamics adapt to confining geometries.Specifically, we use experimental data of joint protrusion-nucleus migrationtrajectories of cells on confining micropatterns to systematically determine amechanistic model linking the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity,protrusions, and nucleus. This model indicates that the cellular dynamics adaptto confining constrictions through a switch in the polarity dynamics from anegative to a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop. Our model furtherreveals how this feedback loop leads to stereotypical cycles ofprotrusion-nucleus dynamics that drive the migration of the cell throughconstrictions. These cycles are disrupted upon perturbation of cytoskeletalcomponents, indicating that the positive feedback is controlled by cellularmigration mechanisms.

We define a 'walkingcilium' as a phenomena where the locomotive force is generated through contactwith a substrate which is periodically reset by steps in the direction ofmotion. We begin by showing that cilia can walk without specialized gaitcontrol and identify the characteristic scales of spatio-temporal heightfluctuations of the tissue. With the addition of surface interaction, weconstruct a low-order dynamical model of this single-cilium sub-unit. Inaddition to studying the dynamics of a single cilium in isolation, wesubsequently examine collections of these walking cilia. En route to anemergent model for ciliary walking, we demonstrate the limits of substratemediated synchronization between cilia. In the desynchronized limit, our modelshows evidence of localized multi-stability mediated by the crosstalk betweenlocomotive forcing and height. The out-of-equilibrium mechanics -- which governthis emergent excitable bistability -- directly control the locomotive forcingof a walking cilia.

Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attentioncapability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memorycomplexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as aconditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate theconditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location canattend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirectattention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations ofembeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attentionpatterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design ofsuch factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$).

Using asingle machine SMORE can perform multi-hop reasoning in Freebase KG (86Mentities, 338M edges), which is 1,500x larger than previously considered KGs.The key to SMORE's runtime performance is a novel bidirectional rejectionsampling that achieves a square root reduction of the complexity of onlinetraining data generation. Furthermore, SMORE exploits asynchronous scheduling,overlapping CPU-based data sampling, GPU-based embedding computation, andfrequent CPU--GPU IO. SMORE increases throughput (i.e., training speed) overprior multi-hop KG frameworks by 2.2x with minimal GPU memory requirements (2GBfor training 400-dim embeddings on 86M-node Freebase) and achieves near linearspeed-up with the number of GPUs. Moreover, on the simpler single-hop knowledgegraph completion task SMORE achieves comparable or even better runtimeperformance to state-of-the-art frameworks on both single GPU and multi-GPUsettings.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14890,arXiv:2110.14890v2,,,10/28/2021,10/28/2021,,Hongyu Ren; Hanjun Dai; Bo Dai; Xinyun Chen; Denny Zhou; Jure Leskovec; Dale Schuurmans,,,,,,,,,1

Using infrared crosslinking immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing (irCLIP-Seq), we show that a subset of mRNAs loses UPF1 binding in ZIKV-infected NPCs, consistent with UPF1's diminished expression. UPF1 target transcripts, however, are not altered in abundance but in subcellular localization, with mRNAs accumulating in the nucleus of infected or UPF1 knockdown cells.

Though, while ideal subunit vaccines strongly rely on antigen and adjuvant(s) selection, the mode and timescale of exposure to the immune system has often been overlooked. Unfortunately, poor control over the delivery of many adjuvants, which play a key role in enhancing the quality and potency of immune responses, can limit their efficacy and cause off-target toxicities. There is critical need for new adjuvant delivery technologies to enhance their efficacy and boost vaccine performance. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to be ideal carriers for improving antigen delivery due to their shape and size, which mimic viral structures, but have been generally less explored for adjuvant delivery. Here, we describe the design of self-assembled poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles decorated with CpG, a potent TLR9 agonist, to increase adjuvanticity in COVID-19 vaccines. By controlling the surface density of CpG, we show that intermediate valency is a key factor for TLR9 activation of immune cells. When delivered with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, CpG NP adjuvants greatly improve the magnitude and duration of antibody responses when compared to free CpG, and result in overall greater breadth of immunity against variants of concern. Moreover, encapsulation of CpG NPs into injectable polymeric-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels enhance the spatiotemporal control over co-delivery of CpG NP adjuvant and spike protein antigen such that a single immunization of hydrogel-based vaccines generates comparable humoral responses as a typical prime-boost regimen of soluble vaccines. These delivery technologies can potentially reduce the costs and burden of clinical vaccination, both of which are key elements in fighting a pandemic.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.02.522505,1.0,new results,01/03/2023,01/03/2023,,Ben S.

However, receptor-based cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), face many critical issues including target recognition escape, adverse side effects, and lack of in vivo control. Drug-controllable receptors offer a promising solution to overcome these issues through precise in vivo tuning of cells via enhanced sensing and therapeutic efficacy. Here we develop a novel class of modular and tunable receptors, termed valency-controlled receptors (VCRs), which can leverage customized small molecules to mediate cell signaling strength via controlled spatial clustering. We first develop DNA origami activated VCRs to demonstrate that receptor valency is a core mechanism that modulates immune cell activation. We design a series of customized valency-control ligands (VCLs) by transforming small molecule drugs into a multivalency format and modularly fusing VCR onto the CAR architecture. We demonstrate that VCL induction allows enhanced target sensitivity of engineered cells. Using medicinal chemistry, we develop programmable bioavailable VCL drugs to demonstrate that the VCR system enables drug-induced highly potent responses towards low antigen cancers in vitro and in vivo.

However whether or not a paper is accepted can depend on random external factors--e.g. the timing of the submission, the matching of editors and reviewers--that are beyond the quality of the work. This article systematically investigates the impact of these random factors independent of the papers quality on peer review outcomes in a major biomedical journal, eLife. We analyzed all of the submissions to eLife between 2016 to 2018, with 23,190 total submissions. We examined the effects of random factors at each decision point in the review process, from the gatekeeping senior editors who may desk-reject papers to review editors and reviewers who recommend the final outcome. Our results suggest that the peer-review process in eLife is robust overall and that random external factors have relatively little quantifiable bias.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.04.522708,1.0,new results,01/04/2023,01/04/2023,,Weixin Liang; Kyle Mahowald; Jennifer Raymond; Vamshi Krishna; Daniel Smith; Daniel Jurafsky; Daniel McFarland; James Zou,"Liang, W.; Mahowald, K.; Raymond, J.; Krishna, V.; Smith, D.; Jurafsky, D.; McFarland, D.; Zou, J.","Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Linguistics, UC Santa Barbara; Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University; Graduate School of Education, Stanford University; Graduate School of Education, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Linguistics, Stanford University; Graduate School of Education, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub","Weixin Liang, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University], [Kyle Mahowald, Department of Linguistics, UC Santa Barbara], [Jennifer Raymond, Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University], [Vamshi Krishna, Graduate School of Education, Stanford University], [Daniel Smith, Graduate School of Education, Stanford University], [Daniel Jurafsky, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Department of Linguistics, Stanford University], [Daniel McFarland, Graduate School of Education, Stanford University], [James Zou, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub",,,,,,1

However, very little is known about both the health and psychological issues VFSWs experience. The objectives of this study were to explore the dominant discourses that emerged from the VFSWs' talk. The interviews occurred between May 2018 and June 2018 with 20 VFSWs who worked in Kaiyuan City, China. The English translated transcripts were analyzed using an eclectic feminist method of discourse analysis. Two discourses emerged. First, ""Agency when working in Karaoke Bars and other Indoor Venues"", and second, ""Negative Impacts on Psychological Well-being and Other Problems from Migration."" As for Discourse 1, the VFSWs positioned themselves as having agency over choosing their clientele as well as agency over what they were willing to negotiate with their clients to establish boundaries of their bodies. As for the Discourse 2, while there was a discourse of agency in their work there was also a contrasting, confounding discourse around the negative impact on psychological well-being and reports of stress as a migrant worker. Discourse 1 and Discourse 2 are confounding. When analyzed together, the discourses suggest that the impacts on psychological well-being may be more related to the migrant status of the women, supporting the notion of systemically influenced agency.",Agency; Discourse analysis; Kaiyuan City; Psychological well-being; Vietnamese female sex workers,,,,,01/07/2023,2023/01/06,2023/1/7,Amanda Wilson; Yu Jin; Chenchang Xiao; Hong Yan; Bin Yu; Mengxi Zhai; Jiayu Li; Yuanyuan Wang,,"College of Education for the Future, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China.; Division of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.; Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, South China Normal University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.; School of Psychology, Center for Studies of Psychological Application, and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.; School of Medicine, Wuhan City College, Wuhan, China.; School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.; School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. yanhmjxr@whu.edu.cn.","Amanda Wilson: Division of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.Yu Jin: College of Education for the Future, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China.Chenchang Xiao: School of Medicine, Wuhan City College, Wuhan, China.Hong Yan: School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. yanhmjxr@whu.edu.cn.Bin Yu: School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.Mengxi Zhai: School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.Jiayu Li: School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.Yuanyuan Wang: Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, South China Normal University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.; School of Psychology, Center for Studies of Psychological Application, and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.",,,,,,0

In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1.0,new results,01/07/2023,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.

However, the underlying disrupted brain connectome and the neural basis remain unclear. In our current study, 38 first-episode, treatment-naive patients with DMD and 22 matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled and received resting-sate functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Voxel-based degree centrality (DC), seed-based functional connectivity (FC), and clinical correlation were performed. Relative to HC, DMD patients had lower height, full Intellectual Quotients (IQ), and IQ-verbal comprehension. Significant increment of DC of DMD patients were found in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC.L) and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC.R), while decreased DC were found in right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL.R), right precentral/postcentral gyrus (Pre/Postcentral G.R). DMD patients had stronger FC in CPL.R-bilateral lingual gyrus, Pre/Postcentral G.R-Insular, and DMPFC.R-Precuneus.R, had attenuated FC in DLPFC.L-Insular.

While the structural features required for conserved autophagy functions of Atg8 are well established, little is known about the molecular changes that facilitated acquisition of divergent, nonautophagic functions of Atg8. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum offers a unique opportunity to study nonautophagic functions of Atg8 family proteins because it encodes a single Atg8 homolog whose only essential function is in the inheritance of an unusual secondary plastid called the apicoplast. Here, we used functional complementation to investigate the structure-function relationship for this divergent Atg8 protein.

Providing haptic feedback of relevant environmental cues to the user or imbuing the prosthesis with autonomous control authority have been separately shown to improve prosthesis utility. Few studies, however, have investigated the effect of combining these two approaches in a shared control paradigm, and none have evaluated such an approach from the perspective of neural efficiency (the relationship between task performance and mental effort measured directly from the brain). In this work, we analyzed the neural efficiency of 30 non-amputee participants in a grasp-and-lift task of a brittle object. Here, a myoelectric prosthesis featuring vibrotactile feedback of grip force and autonomous control of grasping was compared with a standard myoelectric prosthesis with and without vibrotactile feedback. As a measure of mental effort, we captured the prefrontal cortex activity changes using functional near infrared spectroscopy during the experiment. It was expected that the prosthesis with haptic shared control would improve both task performance and mental effort compared to the standard prosthesis. Results showed that only the haptic shared control system enabled users to achieve high neural efficiency, and that vibrotactile feedback was important for grasping with the appropriate grip force. These results indicate that the haptic shared control system synergistically combines the benefits of haptic feedback and autonomous controllers, and is well-poised to inform such hybrid advancements in myoelectric prosthesis technology.",,,,,,01/11/2023,2023/01/10,2023/1/11,Neha Thomas; Alexandra J Miller; Hasan Ayaz; Jeremy D Brown,,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA. neha.thomas@jhmi.edu.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA.; School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Drexel Solutions Institute, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Family and Community Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.","Neha Thomas: Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA. neha.thomas@jhmi.edu.Alexandra J Miller: Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA.Hasan Ayaz: School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Drexel Solutions Institute, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Family and Community Health, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.Jeremy D Brown: Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, USA.",,,,,,0

The set of possible intramolecular interactions of RNA nucleotides defines the range of alternative structural conformations of a specific RNA that can coexist, and these structures enable functional catalytic properties of RNAs and/or their productive intermolecular interactions with other RNAs or proteins. However, the immense combinatorial space of potential RNA sequences has precluded predictive mapping between RNA sequence and molecular structure and function. Recent advances in high-throughput approaches in vitro have enabled quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions, across hundreds of thousands of sequence variations. In this Review, we explore these techniques, how they can be used to understand RNA function and how they might form the foundations of an accurate model to predict the structure and function of an RNA directly from its nucleotide sequence.

Using the antibody sequences of B cells, we tracked clones during in vitro differentiation. Clonal analysis revealed a subset of IgM+ B cells which were more proliferative than other B-cell types. Whereas the population of B cells adopted diverse states during differentiation, clones had a restricted set of fates available to them; there were two times more single-fate clones than expected given population-level cell-type diversity. This implicated a molecular memory of initial cell states that was propagated through differentiation. We then identified the genes which had strongest coherence within clones. These genes significantly overlapped known B-cell fate determination programs, suggesting the genes which determine cell identity are most robustly controlled on a clonal level. Persistent clonal identities were also observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, indicating that these transcriptional programs maintain long-term cell identities in vivo.

We sought new inhibitors of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) activity of Nsp14 with three large library docking strategies. First, up to 1.1 billion make-on-demand (""tangible"") lead-like molecules were docked against the enzymes SAM site, seeking reversible inhibitors. On de novo synthesis and testing, three inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 43 M, each with novel chemotypes. Structure-guided optimization and in vitro characterization supported their non-covalent mechanism. In a second strategy, docking a library of 16 million tangible fragments revealed nine new inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 341 M and ligand efficiencies from 0.29 to 0.42. In a third strategy, a newly created library of 25 million tangible, virtual electrophiles were docked to covalently modify Cys387 in the SAM binding site. Seven inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 3.2 to 39 M, the most potent being a reversible aldehyde. Initial optimization of a second series yielded a 7 M acrylamide inhibitor. Three inhibitors characteristic of the new series were tested for selectivity against 30 human protein and RNA MTases, with one showing partial selectivity and one showing high selectivity. Overall, 32 inhibitors encompassing eleven chemotypes had IC50 values <50 M and 5 inhibitors in four chemotypes had IC50 values <10 M.

Here, we use thousands of microbial communities cultured in vitro from human feces to uncover simple assembly rules and develop a predictive model of community composition upon addition of single nutrients from central carbon metabolism to a complex medium. Community membership was largely determined by the donor feces, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient, due to the ability of fast-growing organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities.

Metabolic cluster and LCA-derived phenotypes were each significantly and independently associated with survival. Hyperinflammatory ARDS patients may be experiencing a glycolytic shift leading to dysregulated lipid metabolism. Metabolic profiling offers prognostic information beyond what is captured by LCA phenotypes alone. Deeper biologic profiling may identify key differences in pathogenesis among patients with ARDS and lead to novel targeted therapies.",ARDS; LCA; Metabolomics; Phenotyping; Precision medicine,,,,,01/18/2023,2023/01/17,2023/1/18,Narges Alipanah-Lechner;

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.

Statement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.

Adaptation to a genetically homogeneous host population should theoretically result in specialization, while adaptation to an evolving host population (i.e., coevolution) can result in various outcomes including diversification, range expansion, and/or local adaptation. For viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, or phages), our understanding of how evolutionary history of the bacterial host(s) impacts viral genotypic and phenotypic evolution is currently limited. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and two different metrics of phage impacts to compare the genotypes and phenotypes of lytic phages that had either coevolved with or were repeatedly passaged on an unchanging (ancestral) strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Genomes of coevolved phages had more mutations than those of phages passaged on a constant host, and most mutations were in genes encoding phage tail-associated proteins. Phages from both passaging treatments shared some phenotypic outcomes, including range expansion and divergence across replicate populations, but coevolved phages were more efficient at reducing population growth (particularly of sympatric coevolved hosts). Genotypic similarity correlated with infectivity profile similarity in coevolved phages, but not in phages passaged on the ancestral host. Overall, while adaptation to either host type (coevolving or ancestral) led to divergence in phage tail proteins and infectivity patterns, coevolution led to more rapid molecular changes that increased bacterial killing efficiency and had more predictable effects on infectivity range. Together, these results underscore the important role of hosts in driving viral evolution and in shaping the genotype-phenotype relationship.",bacteriophage evolution; evolutionary history; experimental evolution; genotype-phenotype relationship; plant pathogen,,,,,01/19/2023,2023/01/18,2023/1/19,Catherine A Hernandez; Véronique A Delesalle; Greg Krukonis; Jenna DeCurzio; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.; Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Catherine A Hernandez: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.Véronique A Delesalle: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Greg Krukonis: Department of Biology, Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX, USA.Jenna DeCurzio: Department of Biology, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,,,,0

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts. Our pipeline of genome-wide association studies with disease liabilities can be applied to other biobanks with rich phenotype and genotype data.",,,medrxiv;2023.01.18.23284383,1,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/19/2023,01/19/2023,,Lu Yang; Marie C.

Resetting TAMs by simple, efficacious and safe approach(s) is highly desirable to enhance antitumor immunity and attenuate tumor cell malignancy. Previously, we used tumor cell-derived microparticles to package chemotherapeutic drugs (drug-MPs), which resulted in a significant treatment outcome in human malignant pleural effusions via neutrophil recruitments, implicating that drug-MPs might reset TAMs, considering the inhibitory effects of M2 macrophages on neutrophil recruitment and activation. Here, we show that drug-MPs can function as an antitumor immunomodulator by resetting TAMs with M1 phenotype and IFN-β release. Mechanistically, drug molecules in tumor MPs activate macrophage lysosomal P450 monooxygenases, resulting in superoxide anion formation, which further amplifies lysosomal ROS production and pH value by activating lysosomal NOX2.

Although the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p53 pathways have been identified as the key intrinsic pathways regulating CNS axon regrowth, little is known about the key upstream regulatory mechanism by which these two major pathways control CNS axon regrowth. By screening genes that regulate ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the p53 proteins in mice, we found that ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B) represses axonal regrowth in retinal ganglion cells and corticospinal neurons. We found that axonal regrowth induced by UBE4B depletion depended on the cooperative activation of p53 and mTOR. Importantly, overexpression of UbV.E4B, a competitive inhibitor of UBE4B, in corticospinal neurons promoted corticospinal axon sprouting and facilitated the recovery of corticospinal axon-dependent function in a cortical stroke model.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation across archaeal ribosomes in the peptidyl transferase center that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,,,,01/21/2023,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Amos J Nissley; Petar I Penev; Zoe L Watson; Jillian F Banfield; Jamie H D Cate,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Amos J Nissley: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Petar I Penev: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Zoe L Watson: California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jamie H D Cate: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,23,1

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway.

Apart from the well-defined diabetic retinopathy, disturbed optic nerve function, which is dependent on the myelin sheath, has recently been recognized as an early feature of visual impairment in diabetes. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Using a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model, we observed a myelin deficiency along with a disturbed composition of oligodendroglial lineage cells in diabetic optic nerve. We found that new myelin deposition, a continuous process that lasts throughout adulthood, was diminished during pathogenesis. Genetically dampening newly generated myelin by conditionally deleting olig2 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells within this short time window extensively delayed the signal transmission of the adult optic nerve. In addition, clemastine, an antimuscarinic compound that enhances myelination, significantly restored oligodendroglia, and promoted the functional recovery of the optic nerve in diabetic mice.

Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins.

Here, we image dopamine modulation in striatal brain tissue slices with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCat) and implement machine learning to determine which features of dopamine modulation are unique to changes in stimulation strength, and to different neuroanatomical regions. We trained a support vector machine and a random forest classifier to determine whether recordings were made from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) versus the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and find that machine learning is able to accurately distinguish dopamine release that occurs in DLS from that occurring in DMS in a manner unachievable with canonical statistical analysis. Furthermore, our analysis determines that dopamine modulatory signals including the number of unique dopamine release sites and peak dopamine released per stimulation event are most predictive of neuroanatomy yet note that integrated neuromodulator amount is the conventional metric currently used to monitor neuromodulation in animal studies. Lastly, our study finds that machine learning discrimination of different stimulation strengths or neuroanatomical regions is only possible in adult animals, suggesting a high degree of variability in dopamine modulatory kinetics during animal development.

Omicron could hardly be neutralized by sera of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents infected with the Delta variant. Through mass spectrometry on MHC-bound peptidomes, we found that the spike protein of the Omicron variants could generate additional CD8 + T cell epitopes, compared with Delta. These epitopes could induce robust CD8 + T cell responses. Moreover, we found booster vaccination increased the cross-memory CD8 + T cell responses against Omicron. Metabolic regulome analysis of Omicron-specific T cell showed a metabolic profile that promoted the response of memory T cells. Consistently, a greater fraction of memory CD8 + T cells existed in Omicron stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, CD147 was also a receptor for the Omicron variants, and CD147 antibody inhibited infection of Omicron. CD147-mediated Omicron infection in a human CD147 transgenic mouse model induced exudative alveolar pneumonia. Taken together, our data suggested that vaccination booster and receptor blocking antibody are two effective strategies against Omicron.",,,,,,01/22/2023,2023/01/21,2023/1/22,Jiejie Geng; Xu Yang; Kun

The aim of this study was to determine how migration influences two ecological currencies, energy expenditure and time allocated towards different behaviors, in a full annual cycle context. We compare these currencies among lesser black-backed gulls that range from short- (< 250 km) to long-distance (> 4500 km) migrants. Daily time-activity budgets were reconstructed from tri-axial acceleration and GPS, which, in conjunction with a bioenergetics model to estimate thermoregulatory costs, enabled us to estimate daily energy expenditure throughout the year. We found that migration strategy had no effect on annual energy expenditure, however, energy expenditure through time deviated more from the annual average as migration distance increased. Patterns in time-activity budgets were similar across strategies, suggesting migration strategy does not limit behavioral adjustments required for other annual cycle stages (breeding, molt, wintering). Variation among individuals using the same strategy was high, suggesting that daily behavioral decisions (e.g. foraging strategy) contribute more towards energy expenditure than an individual's migration strategy. These findings provide unprecedented new understanding regarding the relative importance of fine versus broad-scale behavioral strategies towards annual energy expenditures.",,,,,,01/22/2023,2023/01/21,2023/1/22,J Morgan Brown; Willem Bouten; Kees C J Camphuysen; Bart A Nolet; Judy Shamoun-Baranes,,"Department of Coastal Systems, NIOZ Royal Institute for Sea Research, Texel, The Netherlands.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jmbrown@wcs.org.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, Wageningen, The Netherlands.","J Morgan Brown: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jmbrown@wcs.org.Willem Bouten: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.Kees C J Camphuysen: Department of Coastal Systems, NIOZ Royal Institute for Sea Research, Texel, The Netherlands.Bart A Nolet: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, Wageningen, The Netherlands.Judy Shamoun-Baranes: Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",,,,,,0

Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli (Eco) genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Eco with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis. Together, our study highlights the consequences of co-regulating essential pathways on recipient fitness during interbacterial competition, and how antibacterial toxins leverage cellular vulnerabilities that are both direct and indirect to their specific targets in vivo.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.20.524922,2,new results,01/23/2023,01/23/2023,,Kristine L Trotta; Beth M Hayes; Johannes P Schneider; Jing Wang; Horia Todor; Patrick Rockefeller Grimes; Ziyi Zhao; William Hatleberg; Melanie R Silvis; Rachel Kim; Byoung-Mo Koo; Marek Basler; Seemay Chou,"Trotta, K.

These studies reveal that acetylcholine stabilizes a more heterogeneous M2R-G-protein complex than iperoxo, where two conformers with distinctive G-protein orientations were determined. We find that LY2119620 increases the affinity for both agonists, but differentially modulates agonists efficacy in G-protein and β-arrestin pathways. Structural and spectroscopic analysis suggest that LY211620 stabilizes distinct intracellular conformational ensembles from agonist-bound M2R, which may enhance β-arrestin recruitment while impairing G-protein activation.

Unlike many histone modifications and chromatin-associated proteins, lamina-associated domains (LADs) are mapped genome-wide in relatively few genetically normal human cell types, which limits our understanding of the role peripheral chromatin plays in development and disease.",3D genome;
