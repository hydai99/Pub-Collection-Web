Little is known about how distinct evolutionary pressures have shaped each Argonaute's biophysical properties. We applied high-throughput biochemistry to characterize how Thermus thermophilus Argonaute (TtAgo), a DNA-guided DNA endonuclease, finds, binds, and cleaves its targets. We found that TtAgo uses biophysical adaptations similar to those of eukaryotic Argonautes for rapid association but requires more extensive complementarity to achieve high-affinity target binding. Using these data, we constructed models for TtAgo association rates and equilibrium binding affinities that estimate the nucleic acid- and protein-mediated components of the target interaction energies. Finally, we showed that TtAgo cleavage rates vary widely based on the DNA guide, suggesting that only a subset of guides cleaves targets on physiologically relevant timescales.

Knowledge of circulating immune cell types and states associated with SLE remains incomplete. We profiled more than 1.2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (162 cases, 99 controls) with multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing (mux-seq). Cases exhibited elevated expression of type 1 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in monocytes, reduction of naïve CD4+ T cells that correlated with monocyte ISG expression, and expansion of repertoire-restricted cytotoxic GZMH+ CD8+ T cells. Cell type-specific expression features predicted case-control status and stratified patients into two molecular subtypes. We integrated dense genotyping data to map cell type-specific cis-expression quantitative trait loci and to link SLE-associated variants to cell type-specific expression.

Here we present the Ecological Function oriented Metagenomic Analysis Pipeline (EcoFun-MAP) for efficient analysis of shotgun metagenomes in the context of ecological functions. We manually curated a reference database of EcoFun-MAP which is used for GeoChip design. This database included ∼1,500 functional gene families that were catalogued by important ecological functions, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycling, metal homeostasis, stress responses, organic contaminant degradation, antibiotic resistance, microbial defense, electron transfer, virulence and plant growth promotion. EcoFun-MAP has five optional workflows from ultra-fast to ultra-conservative, fitting different research needs from functional gene exploration to stringent comparison. The pipeline is deployed on High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure with a highly accessible web-based interface. We showed that EcoFun-MAP is accurate and can process multi-million short reads in a minute. We applied EcoFun-MAP to analyze metagenomes from groundwater samples and revealed interesting insights of microbial functional traits in response to contaminations.

Affinity-matured TCRs can enhance the efficacy of TCR-T cell therapy but can also cross-react with off-target antigens, resulting in organ immunopathology. We developed an alternative strategy to isolate TCR mutants that exhibited high activation signals coupled with low-affinity pMHC binding through the acquisition of catch bonds. Engineered analogs of a tumor antigen MAGE-A3-specific TCR maintained physiological affinities while exhibiting enhanced target killing potency and undetectable cross-reactivity, compared with a high-affinity clinically tested TCR that exhibited lethal cross-reactivity with a cardiac antigen.

We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1,267,758 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTLs, with most showing cell type-specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from naïve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to interindividual variation in immune function. Finally, using a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level.

In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al. 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber’s response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles.

Statistical deconvolution of allele frequencies from shotgun metagenomic data into strain genotypes and relative abundances is a promising approach, but existing methods are limited by computational scalability. Here we introduce StrainFacts, a method for strain deconvolution that enables inference across tens of thousands of metagenomes. We harness a “fuzzy” genotype approximation that makes the underlying graphical model fully differentiable, unlike existing methods. This allows parameter estimates to be optimized with gradient-based methods, speeding up model fitting by two orders of magnitude. A GPU implementation provides additional scalability. Extensive simulations show that StrainFacts can perform strain inference on thousands of metagenomes and has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive tools. We further validate our strain inferences using single-cell genomic sequencing from a human stool sample. Applying StrainFacts to a collection of more than 10,000 publicly available human stool metagenomes, we quantify patterns of strain diversity, biogeography, and linkage-disequilibrium that agree with and expand on what is known based on existing reference genomes.

Pollard",biorxiv,An oligogenic inheritance test detects risk genes and their interactions in congenital heart defects and developmental comorbidities,"Exome sequencing of thousands of families has revealed many individual risk genes for congenital heart defects (CHD), yet most cases cannot be explained by a single causal mutation. Further, those who carry de novo and inherited mutations in known risk genes often demonstrate variable phenotypes even within the same family, indicating the presence of genetic modifiers. To explore oligogenic causes of CHD without assessing billions of variant combinations, we developed an efficient, simulation-based method to detect gene sets that carry damaging variants in probands at a higher rate than expected given parental genotypes. We implemented this approach in software called Gene Combinations in Oligogenic Disease (GCOD) and applied it to a cohort of 3382 trios with exome sequencing. This analysis detected 353 high-confidence risk genes in 202 pairs that appear together in multiple probands but rarely or never appear in combination in their unaffected parents. Stratifying analyses by specific CHD diagnosis and considering gene combinations of higher orders yielded an additional 244 gene sets. The oligogenic genes we discovered cluster in pathways specific to heart development and suggest new molecular disease mechanisms, such as arylsulfatase activity and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Finally, by combining CHD families with an autism spectrum disorder cohort, we were able to detect 925 oligogenic sets transmitted in renal disease, a known co-morbidity of both conditions. As genome sequencing is applied to more families and other disorders, GCOD will enable detection of increasingly large, novel gene combinations, shedding light on combinatorial causes of genetic diseases.",,10.1101/2022.04.08.487704,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.08.487704v1,2022.04.08.487704,4/10/2022,,4/10/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes","Gladstone Institutes; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Department of Pediatrics, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Here, we report that deep learning algorithms known as protein language models can evolve human antibodies with high efficiency, despite providing the models with no information about the target antigen, binding specificity, or protein structure, and also requiring no additional task-specific finetuning or supervision. We performed language-model-guided affinity maturation of seven diverse antibodies, screening 20 or fewer variants of each antibody across only two rounds of evolution. Our evolutionary campaigns improved the binding affinities of four clinically relevant antibodies up to 7-fold and three unmatured antibodies up to 160-fold across diverse viral antigens, with many designs also demonstrating improved thermostability and viral neutralization activity. Notably, our algorithm requires only a single wildtype sequence and computes recommended amino acid changes in less than a second. Moreover, the same models that improve antibody binding also guide efficient evolution across diverse protein families and selection pressures, indicating that these results generalize to many natural settings. Contrary to prevailing notions of evolution as difficult and resource-intensive, our results suggest that when constrained to a narrow manifold of evolutionary plausibility, evolution can become much easier, which we refer to as the “efficient manifold hypothesis.”",,10.1101/2022.04.10.487811,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.10.487811v1,2022.04.10.487811,4/11/2022,,4/11/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Stanford ChEM-H; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine","Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

While the structural connectome is at the basis of functional connectome, it is the functional connectivity measured through correlations between time series of individual neurophysiological events that underlies behavioral and mental states. However, in light of the diverse neuronal cell types populating the brain and their unique connectivity properties, both neuronal activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, and the nature of their relationship is not clear. Here, we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to understand the principles of resting state functional connectivity.              Results:                    We recorded the spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the awake resting state forebrain. By classifying their activity (i.e., variances of ΔF/F across time) and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. This finding holds true when neuronal activity and functional connectivity data are classified into five instead of three levels, and in whole brain spontaneous activity datasets. Moreover, such activity-connectivity relationship is not observed in randomly shuffled, noise-added, or simulated datasets, suggesting that it reflects an intrinsic brain network property. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical tools on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity (signal variance over time) and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity.              Conclusions:                    We found a mutually exclusive relationship between high activity (signal variance over time) and high functional connectivity of neurons in zebrafish and human brains. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle, which has implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.

12.0,8/8/2022,Po-Yi Ho;Benjamin H Good;Kerwyn Casey Huang,Elife,Competition for fluctuating resources reproduces statistics of species abundance over time across wide-ranging microbiotas,"Across diverse microbiotas, species abundances vary in time with distinctive statistical behaviors that appear to generalize across hosts, but the origins and implications of these patterns remain unclear. Here, we show that many of these macroecological patterns can be quantitatively recapitulated by a simple class of consumer-resource models, in which the metabolic capabilities of different species are randomly drawn from a common statistical distribution. Our model parametrizes the consumer-resource properties of a community using only a small number of global parameters, including the total number of resources, typical resource fluctuations over time, and the average overlap in resource-consumption profiles across species. We show that variation in these macroscopic parameters strongly affects the time series statistics generated by the model, and we identify specific sets of global parameters that can recapitulate macroecological patterns across wide-ranging microbiotas, including the human gut, saliva, and vagina, as well as mouse gut and rice, without needing to specify microscopic details of resource consumption.

Olzmann",biorxiv,Ribosome stalling during selenoprotein translation exposes a ferroptosis vulnerability in cancer,"Ferroptosis is a regulated, iron-dependent form of necrosis that is triggered by the accumulation of oxidatively damaged phospholipids1–3. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents ferroptosis by converting phospholipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols4, 5. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathology of several degenerative conditions and inhibiting GPX4 activity has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to induce cancer cell death1, 2. However, many cancer cell lines are resistant to GPX4 inhibition6, and the mechanisms that regulate GPX4 activity and ferroptosis resistance remain incompletely understood. Here, employing a synthetic lethal CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor. LRP8 is upregulated in cancer, and we find that it promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells in both 2-dimensional (2-D) cell culture and 3-dimensional (3-D) spheroid models. Mechanistically, loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels, resulting in the reduced expression of a subset of selenoproteins, including GPX4. Remarkably, the reduction in GPX4 is not due to the classic hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program7, 8. Instead, our findings demonstrate that the translation of GPX4 is severely impaired in the selenium-deficient LRP8 knockout (KO) cells due to extensive ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine (SEC) UGA codon, which results in ribosome collisions and early translation termination. Thus, our findings reveal ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as targetable ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer cells.",,10.1101/2022.04.11.487892,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.11.487892v1,2022.04.11.487892,4/11/2022,,4/11/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley; Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,Now published in Nat Chem Biol 10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,1

We paired enhancer labeling and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to delineate and distinguish specification of neuronal lineages in mouse medial, lateral, and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE, and CGE) at embryonic day (E)11.5. We show that scRNA-seq clustering using transcription factors improves resolution of regional and developmental populations, and that enhancer activities identify specific and overlapping GE-derived neuronal populations. First, we mapped the activities of seven evolutionarily conserved brain enhancers at single-cell resolution in vivo, finding that the selected enhancers had diverse activities in specific progenitor and neuronal populations across the GEs. We then applied enhancer-based labeling, scRNA-seq, and analysis of in situ hybridization data to distinguish transcriptionally distinct and spatially defined subtypes of MGE-derived GABAergic and cholinergic projection neurons and interneurons.

In its canonical form, stress-sensing kinases phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2-P), which ultimately leads to reduced levels of ternary complex required for initiation of mRNA translation. Previously we showed that translational control is primarily exerted through a conformational switch in eIF2's nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, which shifts from its active A-State conformation to its inhibited I-State conformation upon eIF2-P binding, resulting in reduced nucleotide exchange on eIF2 (Schoof et al. 2021). Here, we show functionally and structurally how a single histidine to aspartate point mutation in eIF2B's β subunit (H160D) mimics the effects of eIF2-P binding by promoting an I-State like conformation, resulting in eIF2-P independent activation of the ISR.

However, much of the taxonomic and functional diversity of the mouse gut microbiome is missed in current metagenomic studies, because genome databases have not achieved a balanced representation of the diverse members of this ecosystem. Towards solving this problem, we used flow cytometry and low-coverage sequencing to capture the genomes of 764 single cells from the stool of three laboratory mice. From these, we generated 298 high-coverage microbial genome assemblies, which we annotated for open reading frames and phylogenetic placement. These genomes increase the gene catalog and phylogenetic breadth of the mouse microbiota, adding 135 novel species with the greatest increase in diversity to the Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae families.

Mutations within the polycystin complex cause Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). The Polycystin complex forms a non-selective cation channel, yet the spatial and temporal regulation of the polycystin complex within the ciliary membrane remains poorly understood, partially due to technical limitations posed by the tiny ciliary compartment. Here, we employ our novel assays to functionally reconstitute the polycystin complex in the plasma membrane. Using whole-cell and ciliary patch-clamp recordings we identified a ciliary enriched oxysterol, 7β,27-DHC, as a critical component required for activation of the polycystin complex. We identified a novel oxysterol binding pocket in PC-2 using molecular docking simulation. We also identified two amino acids within the PC-2 oxysterol binding pocket, E208 and R581, to be critical for 7β,27-DHC dependent polycystin activation in both the plasma membrane and ciliary compartment. Further, we can show that the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of oxysterol synthesis by carbenoxolone (CNX) reduces channel activity in primary cilia. Our findings identified a unique second messenger that regulates the polycystin complex. We hypothesize that cilia-enriched lipids license the polycystin complex to be functional only in the ciliary organelle, thus providing novel insights into the spatial regulation of the polycystin complex.

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.Methods The gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.Results Variation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR). Notably, the bulk expression product of one identified LR pair (EPHB4-EFNB1) was associated with poor survival in IDC (HR=1.47, p=0.04) suggesting that early remodeling of this stromal-epithelial interaction may have long-lasting impact on disease severity.Conclusions The observed changes in cell states and stromal-epithelial interactions, beyond those driven by difference in cell abundance, may lead to new biomarkers for prognosis and targets for secondary prevention.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502150,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502150v1,2022.07.30.502150,08/02/2022,,08/02/2022,"Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine","Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Harvard Medical School, Harvard University; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Center for Novel Therapeutics and Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California; Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego School of Medicine; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

In vitro assemblies of gut commensals have recently been introduced as models for the intestinal microbiota, which plays fundamental roles in host health. However, a protocol for 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis of in vitro samples that optimizes financial cost, time/effort, and accuracy/reproducibility has yet to be established. Here, we systematically identify protocol elements that have significant impact, introduce bias, and/or can be simplified. Our results indicate that community diversity and composition are generally unaffected by substantial protocol streamlining. Additionally, we demonstrate that a strictly aerobic halophile is an effective spike-in for estimating absolute abundances in communities of anaerobic gut commensals. This time- and money-saving protocol should accelerate discovery by increasing 16S rRNA data reliability and comparability and through the incorporation of absolute abundance estimates.

Yet, there is little research concerning the specific issues involved in scaling up NCD interventions targeting low-resource settings. We propose to examine this gap in up to 27 collaborative projects, which were funded by the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) 2019 Scale Up Call, reflecting a total funding investment of approximately US$50 million. These projects represent diverse countries, contexts and adopt varied approaches and study designs to scale-up complex, evidence-based interventions to improve hypertension and diabetes outcomes. A systematic inquiry of these projects will provide necessary scientific insights into the enablers and challenges in the scale up of complex NCD interventions.              Methods and analysis:                    We will apply systems thinking (a holistic approach to analyse the inter-relationship between constituent parts of scaleup interventions and the context in which the interventions are implemented) and adopt a longitudinal mixed-methods study design to explore the planning and early implementation phases of scale up projects. Data will be gathered at three time periods, namely, at planning (TP), initiation of implementation (T0) and 1-year postinitiation (T1). We will extract project-related data from secondary documents at TP and conduct multistakeholder qualitative interviews to gather data at T0 and T1. We will undertake descriptive statistical analysis of TP data and analyse T0 and T1 data using inductive thematic coding. The data extraction tool and interview guides were developed based on a literature review of scale-up frameworks.              Ethics and dissemination:                    The current protocol was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number 23482). Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and more broadly through the GACD network.

No means exist to molecularly profile bAVMs without open surgery, limiting precision medicine approaches to treatment. Here, we report use of endoluminal biopsy of the vessel lumen of bAVMs to characterize gene expression and blood flow-mediated transcriptional changes in living patients.              Methods:                    Endoluminal biopsy and computational fluid dynamic modeling (CFD) were performed in adults with unruptured AVMs with cerebral angiography. Each patient underwent surgical resection and cell sampling from a contiguous arterial segment. Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting enriched endothelial cells, which were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer. Gene expression was quantified with RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Differential gene expression, ontology, and correlative analyses were performed. Results were validated with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).              Results:                    Endoluminal biopsy was successful in 4 patients without complication. Endoluminal biopsy yielded 269.0 ± 79.9 cells per biopsy (control 309.2 ± 86.6 cells, bAVM 228.8 ± 133.4 cells). RNAseq identified 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bAVMs (false discovery rate ≤0.05). DEGs were enriched for bAVM pathogenic cascades, including Ras-MAPK signaling (p < 0.05), and confirmed with RT-qPCR and a panel predictive of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor response. Compared to patient-matched surgically excised tissues, endoluminal biopsy detected 83.3% of genes, and genome-wide expression strongly correlated (Pearson r = 0.77). Wall shear stress measured by CFD correlated with inflammatory pathway upregulation. Comparison of pre-embolization and postembolization samples confirmed flow-mediated gene expression changes.              Discussion:                    Endoluminal biopsy allows molecular profiling of bAVMs in living patients. Gene expression profiles are similar to those of tissues acquired with open surgery and identify potentially targetable Ras-MAPK signaling abnormalities in bAVMs. Integration with CFD allows determination of flow-mediated transcriptomic alterations. Endoluminal biopsy may help facilitate trials of precision medicine approaches to bAVMs in humans.",35145012.0,10.1212/WNL.0000000000200109.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9052570/,,2/10/2022,4/19/2022,4/19/2022,"1 From the Department of Neurological Surgery (E.W., D.W., E.G., J.R., M.B., D.L., A.A.), Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging (D.M., K.N., Z.S., D.C.), Center for Cerebrovascular Research (H.K., S.W.), Department of Psychiatry (T.N.), Department of Behavioral Sciences (T.N.), and Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research (T.N., D.L.), University of California San Francisco; Siemens Medical Solutions Inc (K.M.), Malvern, PA; and Department of Anatomy (J.R., T.N.), University of California San Francisco, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.",,,2022 Apr 19;98(16):e1637-e1647.,0.0,,

Using a chronic antigen stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to systematically discover genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of several epigenetic regulators, including members of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo paired CRISPR perturbation and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of terminal exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a-depletion limited the global acquisition of chromatin accessibility associated with T cell exhaustion and led to improved anti-tumor immunity after adoptive cell therapy. In summary, we provide a comprehensive atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of the epigenetic state of T cell exhaustion can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.",,10.1101/2022.04.20.488974,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.20.488974v1,2022.04.20.488974,4/21/2022,,4/21/2022,"Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University; Division of BMT and Cell Therapy, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Immunology Graduate Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy; Stanford Brain Organogenesis, Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University; Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco; USA.","Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Immunology Graduate Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University; Stanford Brain Organogenesis, Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy; Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of BMT and Cell Therapy, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine; USA.; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco; Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco; Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California Berkeley; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Immunology Graduate Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy; Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine; USA.",,,0.0,Now published in Cancer Cell 10.1016/j.ccell.2022.06.001.,2

This proof of concept helps establish a technical and conceptual framework that we anticipate will be expanded and applied to additional patients with leukemia, as well as extended to additional cancer types.

We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to generate a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) variant that can be expressed in bacteria and purified in soluble form, unlike the human members of this family (Syk and ZAP-70). The catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and regulation by phosphorylation of this Syk variant are similar to the corresponding properties of human Syk and ZAP-70. Taking advantage of the ability to express this novel Syk-family kinase in bacteria, we developed a two-hybrid assay that couples the growth of E.coli in the presence of an antibiotic to successful phosphorylation of a bait peptide by the kinase. Using this assay, we screened a site-saturation mutagenesis library of the kinase domain of this reconstructed Syk-family kinase. Sites of loss-of-function mutations identified in the screen correlate well with residues established previously as critical to function and/or structure in protein kinases. We also identified activating mutations in the regulatory hydrophobic spine and activation loop, which are within key motifs involved in kinase regulation. Strikingly, one mutation in an ancestral Syk-family variant increases the soluble expression of the protein by 75-fold. Thus, through ancestral sequence reconstruction followed by deep mutational scanning, we have generated Syk-family kinase variants that can be expressed in bacteria with very high yield.",,10.1101/2022.04.24.489292,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.24.489292v1,2022.04.24.489292,4/24/2022,,4/24/2022,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, Columbia University; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Chemistry, Western Washington University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California","Department of Chemistry, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California; Department of Chemistry, Columbia University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Chemistry, Western Washington University; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California",,,0.0,,

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) for parallel quantification of protein and cell lifetimes. We deploy TRAIL over 32 days in 4 mouse tissues to quantify cell proliferation with high precision and no toxicity and determine that protein lifespan varies independently of cell lifespan. Variation in protein lifetime is non-random: multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes across tissues. To model the effects of aging on tissue homeostasis, we apply TRAIL to progeroid mice and uncover fat-specific alterations in cell lifetime and proteome composition, as well as a broad decrease in protein turnover flux. These data indicate that environmental factors influence protein turnover in vivo and provide a framework to understand proteome aging in tissue context.",,10.1101/2022.04.24.488979,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.24.488979v1,2022.04.24.488979,4/24/2022,,4/24/2022,"Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biology, University of Rochester; Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory","Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory; Department of Biology, University of Rochester; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

All-optical systems that combine two photon (2p) calcium imaging and targeted 2p photostimulation enable the activation of specific, functionally defined groups of neurons in behaving animals. However, these techniques do not yet have the ability to reveal how the specific distribution of firing rates across a relevant neural population mediates neural computation and behavior. The key technical obstacle is the inability to transform single-cell calcium signals into accurate estimates of firing rate changes and then write in these cell-specific firing rate changes to each individual neuron in a targeted population. To overcome this challenge, we made two advances: first we introduce a new genetic line of mice for robust Cre-dependent co-expression of a high-performance calcium indicator and a potent soma-targeted microbial opsin. Second, using this line, we developed a pipeline that enables the read-out and write-in of precise population vectors of neural activity across a targeted group of neurons. The combination of the new multifunctional transgenic line and the photostimulation paradigm offer a powerful and convenient platform for investigating the neural codes of computation and behavior.

While mouse models are used extensively to investigate the interplay between microbes and the inflamed state, the paucity of cultured mouse gut microbes has hindered efforts to determine causal relationships. To address this issue, we are assembling the Collection of Inflammation-Associated Mouse Intestinal Bacteria (CIAMIB). The initial release of this collection comprises 41 isolates of 39 unique bacterial species, covering 4 phyla and containing 10 previously uncultivated isolates, including 1 novel family and 7 novel genera. The collection significantly expands the number of available Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Coriobacteriaceae isolates and includes microbes from genera associated with inflammation, such as Prevotella and Klebsiella. We characterized the growth of CIAMIB isolates across a diverse range of nutritional conditions and predicted their metabolic potential and anaerobic fermentation capacity based on the genomes of these isolates. We also provide the first metabolic analysis of species within the genus Adlercreutzia, revealing these representatives to be nitrate-reducing and severely restricted in their ability to grow on carbohydrates. CIAMIB isolates are fully sequenced and available to the scientific community as a powerful tool to study host-microbiota interactions. IMPORTANCE Attempts to explore the role of the microbiota in animal physiology have resulted in large-scale efforts to cultivate the thousands of microbes that are associated with humans. In contrast, relatively few lab mouse-associated bacteria have been isolated, despite the fact that the overwhelming number of studies on the microbiota use laboratory mice that are colonized with microbes that are quite distinct from those in humans. Here, we report the results of a large-scale isolation of bacteria from the intestines of laboratory mice either prone to or suffering from gut inflammation. This collection comprises dozens of novel isolates, many of which represent the only cultured representatives of their genus or species. We report their basic growth characteristics and genomes and are making them widely available to the greater research community.

However, the complexity of these communities poses challenges, particularly for studying rare organisms such as Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria (CPR) and enigmatic entities such as aster-like nanoparticles (ALNs). Here, a reactor was inoculated with water from Lake Fargette, France, and maintained under dark conditions at 4°C for 31 months and enriched for ALNs, diverse Planctomycetes, and CPR bacteria. We reconstructed draft genomes and predicted metabolic traits for 12 diverse Planctomycetes and 9 CPR bacteria, some of which are likely representatives of undescribed families or genera. One CPR genome representing the little-studied lineage ""Candidatus Peribacter"" was curated to completion (1.239 Mbp) and unexpectedly encodes the full gluconeogenesis pathway. Metatranscriptomic data indicate that some planctomycetes and CPR bacteria were active under the culture conditions, accounting for ∼30% and ∼1% of RNA reads mapping to the genome set, respectively. We also reconstructed genomes and obtained transmission electron microscope images for numerous viruses, including one with a >300-kbp genome and several predicted to infect Planctomycetes. Together, our analyses suggest that freshwater Planctomycetes are central players in a subsystem that includes ALNs, symbiotic CPR bacteria, and viruses. IMPORTANCE Laboratory incubations of natural microbial communities can aid in the study of member organisms and their networks of interaction. This is particularly important for understudied lineages for which key elements of basic biology are still emerging. Using genomics and microscopy, we found that members of the bacterial lineage Planctomycetes may be central players in a subset of a freshwater lake microbiome that includes other bacteria, archaea, viruses, and mysterious entities, called aster-like nanoparticles (ALNs), whose origin is unknown. Our results help constrain the possible origins of ALNs and provide insight into possible interactions within a complex lake ecosystem.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.Authors’ Summary Mechanisms underlying nonlytic release of canonical nonenveloped viruses from infected cells are poorly understood. We show here that release of hepatitis A virus from cells in exosome-like vesicles requires nonredundant activities of two distinct Bro1-domain proteins associated with host cell machinery (ESCRT) for endosomal sorting, HD-PTP and ALIX. We demonstrate both Bro1 domain proteins are recruited to the viral capsid by the pX segment of the 1D capsid protein, and that they act in a non-redundant manner to mediate virus release. Fusing pX to a self-assembling nanocage protein resulted in ESCRT-dependent release mediated by a short pX peptide sequence conserved in hepatoviruses from bats to humans. Mutations within the pX sequence ablate release and result in noncytolytic virus accumulating intracellularly. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows nonlytic release of quasi-enveloped virus is an ancient evolutionary trait of hepatoviruses.",,10.1101/2022.04.26.489493,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.26.489493v1,2022.04.26.489493,4/26/2022,,4/26/2022,"Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Cell Biology & Physiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Diamond Light Source; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Diamond Light Source; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Cell Biology & Physiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford; Diamond Light Source; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill",,,0.0,Now published in PLoS Pathog 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010543.,5

As a result, there currently is considerable interest in achieving better control of both the sample thickness and the amount of area that is useful, but this is only one aspect in which improvement is needed. This Perspective addresses the further need to prevent the macromolecular particles from making contact with the air-water interface, something that can result in preferential orientation and even structural disruption of macromolecular particles. This unwanted contact can occur either as the result of free diffusion of particles during the interval between application, thinning and vitrification of the remaining buffer, or-when particles have been immobilized-by the film of buffer becoming too thin prior to vitrification. An opportunity now exists to apply theoretical and practical insights from the fields of thin-film physical chemistry and interfacial science, in an effort to bring cryo-EM sample preparation to a level of sophistication that is comparable to that of current data collection and analysis.

Light is such a stimulus, which is used in treating mood disorders often associated with a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis. Relationships between the emotional valence of light and the hypothalamus, and how they interact to exert brain-wide impacts remain unclear. Employing larval zebrafish with analogous hypothalamic systems to mammals, we show in free-swimming animals that hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor (CRFHy) neurons promote dark avoidance, and such role is not shared by other hypothalamic peptidergic neurons. Single-neuron projection analyses uncover processes extended by individual CRFHy neurons to multiple targets including sensorimotor and decision-making areas. In vivo calcium imaging uncovers a complex and heterogeneous response of individual CRFHy neurons to the light or dark stimulus, with a reduced overall sum of CRF neuronal activity in the presence of light. Brain-wide calcium imaging under alternating light/dark stimuli further identifies distinct and distributed photic response neuronal types. CRFHy neuronal ablation increases an overall representation of light in the brain and broadly enhances the functional connectivity associated with an exploratory brain state. These findings delineate brain-wide photic perception, uncover a previously unknown role of CRFHy neurons in regulating the perception and emotional valence of light, and suggest that light therapy may alleviate mood disorders through reducing an overall sum of CRF neuronal activity.",35484242.0,10.1038/s41380-022-01567-x.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01567-x,,,4/28/2022,4/28/2022,"1 Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143-2811, USA.2 Department of Bioengineering, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.3 Neurobiology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.4 Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience, Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA.5 Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.6 Invitae Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Gladstone Institute of Data Science & Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.11 Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143-2811, USA. su.guo@ucsf.edu.12 Programs in Human Genetics and Biological Sciences, Kavli Institute of Fundamental Neuroscience, The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Bakar Aging Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143-2811, USA. su.guo@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Apr 28.,0.0,,

The algorithm discriminatesmortality with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) surpassing the discriminationof the RCRI score with an AUC of 0.67 (CI 0.61-0.72) in the held out testcohort. Patients determined to be high risk by the deep learning model's riskprediction had an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 8.83 (5.57-13.20) forpost-operative mortality as compared to an unadjusted OR of 2.08 (CI 0.77-3.50)for post-operative mortality for RCRI greater than 2. The deep learningalgorithm performed similarly for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with anAUC of 0.85 (CI 0.77-0.92), non-cardiac surgery with an AUC of 0.83(0.79-0.88), and catherization or endoscopy suite procedures with an AUC of0.76 (0.72-0.81). The algorithm similarly discriminated risk for mortality intwo separate external validation cohorts from independent healthcare systemswith AUCs of 0.79 (0.75-0.83) and 0.75 (0.74-0.76) respectively. Conclusion.The findings demonstrate how a novel deep learning algorithm, applied topre-operative ECGs, can improve discrimination of post-operative mortality.",,10.48550/arXiv.2205.03242,https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03242,arXiv:2205.03242v1,4/30/2022,,4/30/2022,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03242,,0.0,,

A hallmark pathological feature of both diseases is the depletion of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus in the brain and spinal cord of patients. A major function of TDP-43 is to repress the inclusion of cryptic exons during RNA splicing. When it becomes depleted from the nucleus in disease, this function is lost, and recently, several key cryptic splicing targets of TDP-43 have emerged, including STMN2, UNC13A, and others. UNC13A is a major ALS/FTD risk gene, and the genetic variations that increase the risk for disease seem to do so by making the gene more susceptible to cryptic exon inclusion when TDP-43 function is impaired. Here, we discuss the prospects and challenges of harnessing these cryptic splicing events as novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Deciphering this new cryptic code may be a touchstone for ALS and FTD diagnosis and treatment.

Objective:                    To evaluate field performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test (Abbott) compared with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting infection with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.              Design:                    Cross-sectional surveillance study.              Setting:                    Free, walk-up, outdoor, urban community testing and vaccine site led by Unidos en Salud, serving a predominantly Latinx community highly impacted by COVID-19.              Participants:                    Persons seeking COVID-19 testing in January 2022.              Measurements:                    Simultaneous BinaxNOW and RT-PCR from nasal, cheek, and throat swabs, including cycle threshold (Ct) measures; a lower Ct value is a surrogate for higher amounts of virus.              Results:                    Among 731 persons tested with nasal swabs, there were 296 (40.5%) positive results on RT-PCR; 98.9% were the Omicron variant. BinaxNOW detected 95.2% (95% CI, 91% to 98%) of persons who tested positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 30, 82.1% (CI, 77% to 87%) of those who tested positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 35, and 65.2% (CI, 60% to 71%) of all who were positive on RT-PCR. Among 75 persons with simultaneous nasal and cheek swabs, BinaxNOW using a cheek swab failed to detect 91% (20 of 22) of specimens that were positive on BinaxNOW with a nasal swab. Among persons with simultaneous nasal and throat swabs who were positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 30, 42 of 49 (85.7%) were detected by nasal BinaxNOW, 23 of 49 (46.9%) by throat BinaxNOW, and 44 of 49 (89.8%) by either.              Limitation:                    Participants were a cross-sectional sample from a community-based sentinel surveillance site, precluding study of viral or symptom dynamics.              Conclusion:                    BinaxNOW detected persons with high SARS-CoV-2 levels during the Omicron surge, enabling rapid responses to positive test results. Cheek or throat swabs should not replace nasal swabs. As currently recommended, high-risk persons with an initial negative BinaxNOW result should have repeated testing.

Skotheim, Paul Francois",biorxiv,Evolution of cell size control is canalized towards adders or sizers by cell cycle structure and selective pressures,"Cell size is controlled to be within a specific range to support physiological function. To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from ‘sizers’, in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to ‘adders’, in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks. If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells in vivo, sizers become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for the fission yeast S. pombe. For some size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division cycle of the green algae Chlamydomonas. That these size control networks evolved such self-organized criticality shows how the evolution of complex systems can drive the emergence of critical processes.",,10.1101/2022.04.12.488093,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.12.488093v3,2022.04.12.488093,5/1/2022,,5/1/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Physics, McGill University","Department of Physics, McGill University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Physics, McGill University",,,0.0,,

Ixodes pacificus, the tick vector of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) in the western U.S., feeds on rodents, birds, and lizards. Rodents and birds are reservoirs for Bb and infect juvenile ticks, while lizards are refractory to Bb and cannot infect feeding ticks. Additionally, the lizard bloodmeal contains borreliacidal properties, clearing previously infected feeding ticks of their Bb infection. Despite I. pacificus feeding on a range of hosts, it is undetermined how the host identity of the larval bloodmeal affects future nymphal vector competency. We experimentally evaluate the influence of larval host bloodmeal on Bb acquisition by nymphal I. pacificus. Larval I. pacificus were fed on either lizards or mice and after molting, nymphs were fed on Bb-infected mice. We found that lizard-fed larvae were significantly more likely to become infected with Bb during their next bloodmeal than mouse-fed larvae. We also conducted the first RNA-seq analysis on whole-bodied I. pacificus and found significant upregulation of tick antioxidants and antimicrobial peptides in the lizard-fed group. Our results indicate that the lizard bloodmeal significantly alters vector competency and gene regulation in ticks, highlighting the importance of host bloodmeal identity in vector-borne disease transmission and upends prior notions about the role of lizards in Lyme disease community ecology.

Despite this, the causes of pneumonia in this population remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess the feasibility of metatranscriptomics for epidemiological surveillance of pneumonia in patients with HIV in Uganda.              Methods:                    We performed a retrospective observational study in patients with HIV who were admitted to Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda between Oct 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2011. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, HIV-positivity, and clinically diagnosed pneumonia. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to bronchoscopy or an existing diagnosis of tuberculosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected within 72 h of admission and a combination of RNA sequencing and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture plus PCR were performed. The primary outcome was detection of an established or possible respiratory pathogen in the total study population.              Findings:                    We consecutively enrolled 217 patients during the study period. A potential microbial cause for pneumonia was identified in 211 (97%) patients. At least one microorganism of established respiratory pathogenicity was identified in 113 (52%) patients, and a microbe of possible pathogenicity was identified in an additional 98 (45%). M tuberculosis was the most commonly identified established pathogen (35 [16%] patients; in whom bacterial or viral co-infections were identified in 13 [37%]). Streptococcus mitis, although not previously reported as a cause of pneumonia in patients with HIV, was the most commonly identified bacterial organism (37 [17%] patients). Haemophilus influenzae was the most commonly identified established bacterial pathogen (20 [9%] patients). Pneumocystis jirovecii was only identified in patients with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells per mL.              Interpretation:                    We show the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics for epidemiologic surveillance of pneumonia by describing the spectrum of respiratory pathogens in adults with HIV in Uganda.

However, extracting structure information from such data presents unique challenges. Here, we introduce a set of computational tools for the systematic analysis of data from a wide variety of crosslink-ligation methods, specifically focusing on read mapping, alignment classification, and clustering. We design a new strategy to map short reads with irregular gaps at high sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of previously published data reveals distinct properties and bias caused by the crosslinking reactions. We perform rigorous and exhaustive classification of alignments and discover eight types of arrangements that provide distinct information on RNA structures and interactions. To deconvolve the dense and intertwined gapped alignments, we develop a network/graph-based tool Crosslinked RNA Secondary Structure Analysis using Network Techniques (CRSSANT), which enables clustering of gapped alignments and discovery of new alternative and dynamic conformations. We discover that multiple crosslinking and ligation events can occur on the same RNA, generating multisegment alignments to report complex high-level RNA structures and multi-RNA interactions. We find that alignments with overlapped segments are produced from potential homodimers and develop a new method for their de novo identification. Analysis of overlapping alignments revealed potential new homodimers in cellular noncoding RNAs and RNA virus genomes in the Picornaviridae family.

In oncology, bacterial metabolism has been implicated in both drug efficacy5,6 and toxicity7,8; however, the degree to which bacterial drug sensitivity and metabolism can be driven by conserved pathways also found in mammalian cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that anticancer fluoropyrimidine drugs inhibit the growth of diverse gut bacterial strains by disrupting pyrimidine metabolism, as in mammalian cells.

Through superresolution microscopy, we show that the peripheral ER in the mammalian cell adopts two distinct forms of tubules. Whereas an ultrathin form, R1, is consistently covered by ER-membrane curvature-promoting proteins, for example, Rtn4 in the native cell, in the second form, R2, Rtn4 and analogs are arranged into two parallel lines at a conserved separation of ∼105 nm over long ranges. The two tubule forms together account for ∼90% of the total tubule length in the cell, with either one being dominant in different cell types. The R1–R2 dichotomy and the final tubule geometry are both coregulated by Rtn4 (and analogs) and the ER sheet–maintaining protein Climp63, which, respectively, define the edge curvature and lumen height of the R2 tubules to generate a ribbon-like structure of well-defined width. Accordingly, the R2 tubule width correlates positively with the Climp63 intraluminal size. The R1 and R2 tubules undergo active remodeling at the second/subsecond timescales as they differently accommodate proteins, with the former effectively excluding ER-luminal proteins and ER-membrane proteins with large intraluminal domains.

Unexpectedly, the pattern of T cell responses suggests that many T cells in the gut repertoire recognize multiple bacterial strains from the community. We constructed T cell hybridomas from 92 T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes; by screening every strain in the community against each hybridoma, we find that nearly all of the bacteria-specific TCRs exhibit a one-to-many TCR-to-strain relationship, including 13 abundant TCR clonotypes that are polyspecific for 18 Firmicutes in the community.

While much is known about constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently identified a mutation in the innate immune protein S100A9 that provides insight into such constraints. When introduced into human S100A9, M63F simultaneously increases the stability of the protein and disrupts its natural ability to activate Toll-like receptor 4. Using chemical denaturation, we found that M63F stabilizes a calcium-bound conformation of hS100A9. We then used NMR to solve the structure of the mutant protein, revealing that the mutation distorts the hydrophobic binding surface of hS100A9, explaining its deleterious effect on function. Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments revealed stabilization of the region around M63F in the structure, notably Phe37. In the structure of the M63F mutant, the Phe37 and Phe63 sidechains are in contact, plausibly forming an edge-face ν-stack. Mutating Phe37 to Leu abolished the stabilizing effect of M63F as probed by both chemical denaturation and HDX. It also restored the biological activity of S100A9 disrupted by M63F. These findings reveal that Phe63 creates a “molecular staple” with Phe37 that stabilizes a non-functional conformation of the protein, thus disrupting function. Using a bioinformatic analysis, we found that S100A9 proteins from different organisms rarely have Phe at both positions 37 and 63, suggesting that avoiding a pathological stabilizing interaction indeed constrains S100A9 evolution. This work highlights an important evolutionary constraint on stabilizing mutations: they must avoid inappropriately stabilizing non-functional protein conformations.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Protein stability constrains protein evolution. While much is known about evolutionary constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently found a mutation to an innate immune protein that increases its stability but disrupts its function. Here we show, through careful biophysical and functional studies, that this mutation stabilizes a nonfunctional form of the protein through a direct interaction with another amino acid. We find that specific amino acids can be tolerated at each of the interacting positions individually, but not at both simultaneously. This pattern has been conserved over millions of years of evolution.

Here we show healthy human lung slices cultured ex vivo can be productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the cellular tropism of the virus and its distinct and dynamic effects on host cell gene expression can be determined by single cell RNA sequencing and reconstruction of “infection pseudotime” for individual lung cell types. This revealed the prominent SARS-CoV-2 target is a population of activated interstitial macrophages, which as infection proceeds accumulate thousands of viral RNA molecules per cell, comprising up to 60% of the cellular transcriptome and including canonical and novel subgenomic RNAs. During viral takeover, there is cell-autonomous induction of a specific host interferon program and seven chemokines (CCL2, 7, 8, 13, CXCL10) and cytokines (IL6, IL10), distinct from the response of alveolar macrophages in which neither viral takeover nor induction of a substantial inflammatory response occurs. Using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, we show that entry into purified human lung macrophages depends on Spike but is not blocked by cytochalasin D or by an ACE2-competing monoclonal antibody, indicating a phagocytosis- and ACE2-independent route of entry. These results provide a molecular characterization of the initiation of COVID-19 in human lung tissue, identify activated interstitial macrophages as a prominent site of viral takeover and focus of inflammation, and suggest targeting of these macrophages and their signals as a new therapeutic modality for COVID-19 pneumonia and progression to ARDS.

Infection of alveolar macrophages was partially dependent upon their expression of ACE2, and the infections were productive for amplifying virus, both findings which were in contrast with their neutralization of another pandemic virus, Influenza A virus (IAV). Compared to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 was extremely poor at inducing interferon-stimulated genes in infected myeloid cells, providing a window of opportunity for modest titers to amplify within these cells. Endotracheal aspirate samples from humans with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 confirmed the lung slice findings, revealing a persistent myeloid depot. In the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, myeloid cells may provide a safe harbor for the virus with minimal immune stimulatory cues being generated, resulting in effective viral colonization and quenching of the immune system.",,10.1101/2022.04.28.489942,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.28.489942v2,2022.04.28.489942,5/11/2022,,5/11/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; CoLabs Initiative, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; Gladstone Institutes","Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; CoLabs Initiative, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; CoLabs Initiative, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pathology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California",,,0.0,,

A growing body of evidence supports their potential health benefits, but the mechanistic basis of their effects on the gut microbiome and host immunity remain to be elucidated. Fermented foods are diverse, each representing a complex mixture of food, microbes, and metabolites creating a significant challenge to disentangle the effects of individual components. Herein, we further define the chemical signature of individual fermented foods to categorize them based on the primary metabolic end-products of fermentation. Using mouse models, we find that fermented foods have both microbiome directed as well as differential host directed effects that correspond to their metabolite composition. Fermented food brine drink shows site-specific restructuring of the gut microbiome and promotion of tolerogenic barrier immunity; fractionation of the brine to examine the effects of the microbe-free, metabolite rich supernatant shows similar activity. Lactate, the main metabolite of lactic acid fermentation and the major metabolite within the brine drink, when administered in water, fuels a trans-kingdom metabolic network to selectively promote the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila. in the small intestine, while promoting immune tolerance via an increase in microbiota-dependent Regulatory T-cells. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of fermented food consumption can be mediated by microbial metabolites within fermented foods, independent of microbial content, and highlight the importance of further defining the diverse chemical landscape of fermented foods to inform their potential health benefits and therapeutic use.",,10.1101/2022.05.11.490523,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.11.490523v1,2022.05.11.490523,5/12/2022,,5/12/2022,"Center for Human Microbiome Studies, Stanford University School of Medicine; ChEM-H, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Departments of Genetics, Stanford University","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Departments of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Center for Human Microbiome Studies, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

However, whether specific astrocytic outputs follow specific GPCR activity remains unclear, and exploring this question is critical for understanding how astrocytes ultimately influence brain function and behavior. We previously showed that astrocytic Gi-GPCR activation is sufficient to increase slow-wave neural activity (SWA) during sleep when activated in cortical astrocytes1. Here, we investigate the outputs of astrocytic Gi-GPCRs, focusing on the regulation of extracellular glutamate and GABA, by combining in vivo fiber photometry recordings of the extracellular indicators iGluSnFR and iGABASnFR with astrocyte-specific chemogenetic Gi-GPCR activation. We find that Gi-GPCR activation does not change spontaneous dynamics of extracellular glutamate or GABA. However, Gi-GPCR activation does specifically increase visual stimulus-evoked extracellular glutamate. Together, these data point towards a complex relationship between astrocytic inputs and outputs in vivo that may depend on behavioral context.

To enable automated and quantitative analysis of morphodynamic states, we developed DynaMorph-a computational framework that combines quantitative live cell imaging with self-supervised learning. To demonstrate the robustness and utility of this approach, we used DynaMorph to annotate morphodynamic states observed with label-free measurements of optical density and anisotropy of live microglia isolated from human brain tissue. These cells show complex behavior and have varied responses to disease-relevant perturbations. DynaMorph generates quantitative morphodynamic representations that can be used to compare the effects of the perturbations.

However, whether more actin assembles at endocytic sites in response to increased load has not previously been investigated. Here actin network ultrastructure at CME sites was examined under low and high membrane tension. Actin and N-WASP spatial organization indicate that actin polymerization initiates at the base of clathrin-coated pits and that the network then grows away from the plasma membrane. Actin network height at individual CME sites was not coupled to coat shape, raising the possibility that local differences in mechanical load feed back on assembly. By manipulating membrane tension and Arp2/3 complex activity, we tested the hypothesis that actin assembly at CME sites increases in response to elevated load. Indeed, in response to elevated membrane tension, actin grew higher, resulting in greater coverage of the clathrin coat, and CME slowed. When membrane tension was elevated and the Arp2/3 complex was inhibited, shallow clathrin-coated pits accumulated, indicating that this adaptive mechanism is especially crucial for coat curvature generation.

Diet, in particular the microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fiber, is one of the most powerful ways to affect the composition and metabolic output of the gut microbiome. As such, diet is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of C. difficile and for developing alternative approaches for coping with this pathogen. One prominent class of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic end products of MAC metabolism. SCFAs are known decrease the fitness of C. difficile in vitro and that high intestinal SCFA concentrations are associated with reduced fitness of C. difficile in animal models of C. difficile infection (CDI). Here, we use controlled dietary conditions (8 diets that differ only by MAC composition) to show that C. difficile fitness is most consistently impacted by butyrate, rather than the other two prominent SCFAs (acetate and propionate), during murine model CDI. We similarly show that butyrate concentrations are lower in fecal samples from humans with CDI relative to healthy controls. Finally, we demonstrate that butyrate impacts growth in diverse C. difficile isolates. These findings provide a foundation for future work which will dissect how butyrate directly impacts C. difficile fitness and will lead to the development of diverse approaches distinct from antibiotics or fecal transplant, such as dietary interventions, for mitigating CDI in at-risk human populations.IMPORTANCE Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea in humans and it imposes a tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Current treatments for C. difficile infection (CDI) include antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, which contribute to recurrent CDIs and face major regulatory hurdles, respectively. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop new ways to cope with CDI. Notably, a disrupted “dysbiotic” gut microbiota is the primary risk factor for CDI but we incompletely understand how a healthy microbiota resists CDI. Here, we show that a specific molecule produced by the gut microbiota, butyrate, is negatively associated with C. difficile burdens in humans and in a mouse model of CDI and that butyrate impedes the growth of diverse C. difficile strains in pure culture. These findings help to build a foundation for designing alternative, possibly diet-based, strategies for mitigating CDI in humans.",,10.1101/2022.05.20.492898,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.20.492898v1,2022.05.20.492898,5/21/2022,,5/21/2022,"Abbott, Nutrition Division; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub; Chemical Glycobiology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute and Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University; Interface Biosciences Inc; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison","Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Interface Biosciences Inc; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of California; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Chemical Glycobiology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute and Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Abbott, Nutrition Division; Abbott, Nutrition Division; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

However, most current photo-responsive DNA switches are limited either by irreversible switching or reversible switching with impractically slow kinetics. Here, we report the design of an intramolecular triplex photoswitch (TPS) design based on single-stranded DNA that undergoes rapid and reversible photoswitching between folded and unfolded states through isomerization of internal azobenzene modifications. After optimizing the performance of our photoswitch design, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how individual azobenzenes contribute to the stabilization or destabilization of the triplex depending on their photoisomerization state. By coupling our TPS to an existing aptamer, we can reversibly modulate its binding affinity with less than 15 seconds of UV light exposure. We further demonstrate reproducible shifting in affinity over multiple cycles of UV and blue light irradiation without substantial photobleaching. Given that our TPS can introduce switching functionality to aptamers without manipulating the aptamer sequence itself, we believe our design methodology should offer a versatile means for integrating photo-responsive properties into DNA nanostructures.",,10.1101/2022.05.22.492975,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.22.492975v1,2022.05.22.492975,5/22/2022,,5/22/2022,"Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Radiology, Stanford University","Department of Radiology, Stanford University; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Radiology, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Radiology, Stanford University; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University",,,0.0,,

Testing with BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests was available regardless of age, vaccine status, or symptoms throughout.Main Outcomes and Measures We characterized the prevalence of specific symptoms for people with a positive BinaxNOW test during the Omicron period and compared it to the pre-Delta and Delta periods. During the Omicron period, we examined differences in symptoms by age and vaccine status. Among people returning for repeat testing during Omicron period, we estimated the proportion with a positive BinaxNOW antigen test between 4-14 days from symptom onset or since first positive test if asymptomatic.Results Of 63,277 persons tested, 18,301 (30%) reported symptoms and 4,568 (25%) tested positive for COVID-19. During the Omicron period, 41.6% (3032/7283) of symptomatic testers tested positive, and the proportion reporting cough (67.4%) and sore throat (43.4%) was higher than during Delta and pre-Delta periods. Congestion was higher during Omicron (38.8%) than during the pre-Delta period and loss of taste/smell (5.3%) and fever (30.4%) were less common. Fevers and myalgias were less common among persons who had received boosters compared to unvaccinated people or those who received the primary series. Five days after symptom onset, 31.1% of people with COVID-19 stated their symptoms were similar or worsening. An estimated 80.2% of symptomatic re-testers remained positive five days after symptom onset and 60.5% after ten days.Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 upper respiratory tract symptoms were more commonly reported during the Omicron period compared to pre-Delta and Delta periods, with differences by vaccination status. Antigen test positivity remained high after 5 days, supporting guidelines requiring a negative test to shorten the isolation period.Question During the Omicron period, are there differences in COVID-19 symptomatology compared to the pre-Delta and Delta periods and how long do rapid antigen tests remain positive?Findings In this community-based surveillance study we detected differences in symptomatology between the Omicron period and prior variant-periods, and by age and vaccination status. Five days after symptom onset, 80% remained positive with a BinaxNOW test.Meaning During the Omicron period, differences in symptomatology may be due to rising population immunity and a new variant.

Still, optimal combination, order, and timing of administration remains under investigation. Here, we measure how MEK inhibition (MEKi) alters anti-tumor immunity by utilizing quantitative immunopeptidomics to profile changes in the peptide MHC (pMHC) repertoire. These data reveal a collection of tumor antigens whose presentation levels are selectively augmented following therapy, including several epitopes present at over 1000 copies-per-cell. We leveraged the tunable abundance of MEKi-modulated antigens by targeting 4 epitopes with pMHC-specific T cell engagers and antibody drug conjugates, enhancing cell killing in tumor cells following MEK inhibition. These results highlight drug treatment as a means to enhance immunotherapy efficacy by targeting specific upregulated pMHCs and provide a methodological framework for identifying, quantifying, and therapeutically targeting additional epitopes of interest.SIGNIFICANCE Kinase inhibitor treatment in NRAS/BRAF mutant melanoma can sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, in part through an increase in average surface presentation of peptide MHC molecules.

However, existing methods only model the image-levelfeatures, and do not ground them and reason with background concepts such asknowledge graphs (KGs). In this work, we propose a novel visual questionanswering method, VQA-GNN, which unifies the image-level information andconceptual knowledge to perform joint reasoning of the scene.

Our VQA-GNN then learns to aggregate messagesand reason across different modalities captured by the multimodal semanticgraph.

The aim is to determine the incidence and risk factors for neurodegenerative disease and/or age-related effects on brain health in this population.Methods and analysis A population of retired male and female elite athletes and controls aged 40-85 years, will be assessed at baseline and serial time points over 10 years during life using a multi-dimensional assessment including: Questionnaire; SCAT3/5; Neurological and physical examination; Instrumented balance assessment; Computerised neurocognitive screen; Neuropsychological assessment; Advanced MR brain neuroimaging; Visual saccades; Blood workup; Fluid biomarkers; Gut metabolomics; Salivary MicroRNA analysis; Genetic analysis; and where available Brain banking and neuropathologyEthics and dissemination Ethics approval was granted by St Mary’s University SMEC as well as at the various satellite trial sites. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (BioMed Central) with ID number: 11312093. In addition to the usual dissemination process, this phenotypically well-characterised dataset will reside in a publicly accessible infrastructure of integrated databases, imaging repositories, and biosample repositories and de-identified data will be made available to collaborating researchers.",,10.1101/2022.05.25.22275489,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/05/27/2022.05.25.22275489,2022.05.25.22275489,5/27/2022,,5/27/2022,"Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital;

In scRNA-seq data, however, nuisance variation due to technical factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying biological signal. Deep generative models have been extensively applied to scRNA-seq data, with a special focus on embedding cells into a low-dimensional latent space and correcting for batch effects. However, little attention has been given to the problem of utilizing the uncertainty from the deep generative model for differential expression. Furthermore, the existing approaches do not allow controlling for the effect size or the false discovery rate. Here, we present lvm-DE, a generic Bayesian approach for performing differential expression from using a fitted deep generative model, while controlling the false discovery rate.

Here, we develop a framework to distinguish the effects of resource competition from other interaction mechanisms by integrating data from growth measurements in spent media, synthetic community assembly, and metabolomics with consumer-resource models. When applied to human gut commensals, our framework revealed that resource competition alone could explain most pairwise interactions. The resource-competition landscape inferred from metabolomic profiles of individual species predicted assembly compositions, demonstrating that resource competition is a dominant driver of in vitro community assembly.

By single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of over 20,000 differentiating white and brown preadipocytes, we constructed a high-resolution temporal transcriptional landscape of human white and brown adipogenesis. White and brown preadipocytes were isolated from a single individual’s neck region, thereby eliminating inter-subject variability across two distinct lineages. These preadipocytes were also immortalized to allow for controlled, in vitro differentiation, allowing sampling of distinct cellular states across the spectrum of adipogenic progression. Pseudotemporal cellular ordering revealed the dynamics of ECM remodeling during early adipogenesis, and lipogenic/thermogenic response during late white/brown adipogenesis. Comparison with adipogenic regulation in murine models revealed several targets for potential adipogenic/thermogenic drivers in humans. Key adipogenic and lipogenic markers revealed in our analysis were applied to analyze publicly available scRNA-seq datasets; these confirmed unique cell maturation features in recently discovered murine preadipocytes, and revealed inhibition of adipogenic expansion in humans with obesity.

Here, we created a CRISPRi library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain 3610. We show that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. We developed an image analysis algorithm to quantify biofilm colony wrinkling, which identified strains with high or low levels of wrinkling that were uncorrelated with extracellular matrix gene expression. We also designed a high-throughput screen for sensitive quantification of sporulation efficiency and performed the first screens of sporulation during essential gene knockdown. We found that all basal knockdowns of essential genes were competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but certain strains exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased wrinkling and inhibited sporulation. These results highlight the importance of essential genes in biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes. Importance For many bacteria, life typically involves growth in dense, three-dimensional communities called biofilms that contain cells with differentiated roles and are held together by extracellular matrix. To examine how gene function varies between non-biofilm and biofilm growth, we created a comprehensive library of strains using CRISPRi to knockdown expression of each essential gene in the model species Bacillus subtilis 3610, which can develop into a wrinkled biofilm structure or a spore capable of surviving harsh environments. This library enabled us to determine when gene essentiality depends on growth conditions. We also developed high-throughput assays and computational algorithms to identify essential genes involved in biofilm wrinkling and sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased the density of wrinkles, and also inhibited sporulation in a medium with generally lower sporulation levels.

Etv2 is a master transcriptional regulator required for the development of both lineages. However, the mechanisms through which Etv2 initiates the gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) for endothelial and erythropoietic specification and how the two GRNs diverge downstream of Etv2 remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing a hypomorphic Etv2 mutant, we demonstrate different threshold requirements for initiation of the downstream GRNs for endothelial and erythropoietic development. We show that Etv2 functions directly in a coherent feedforward transcriptional network for vascular endothelial development, and a low level of Etv2 expression is sufficient to induce and sustain the endothelial GRN. In contrast, Etv2 induces the erythropoietic GRN indirectly via activation of Tal1, which requires a significantly higher threshold of Etv2 to initiate and sustain erythropoietic development.

We reported that AAK1 and GAK control intracellular trafficking of RNA viruses and revealed a requirement for BIKE in early and late stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, the downstream targets phosphorylated by BIKE have not yet been identified. Here, to identify BIKE substrates, we conducted a barcode fusion genetics-yeast two-hybrid screen and retrieved publicly available data generated via affinity-purification mass spectrometry. We subsequently validated 19 of 47 putative BIKE interactors using mammalian cell-based protein-protein interaction assays. We found that CLINT1, a cargo-specific adapter implicated in bidirectional Golgi-to-endosome trafficking, emerged as a predominant hit in both screens. Our experiments indicated that BIKE catalyzes phosphorylation of a threonine 294 CLINT1 residue both in vitro and in cell culture. Our findings revealed that CLINT1 phosphorylation mediates its binding to the DENV nonstructural 3 protein and subsequently promotes DENV assembly and egress. Additionally, using live-cell imaging we revealed that CLINT1 cotraffics with DENV particles and is involved in mediating BIKE's role in DENV infection. Finally, our data suggest that additional cellular BIKE interactors implicated in the host immune and stress responses and the ubiquitin proteasome system might also be candidate phosphorylation substrates of BIKE. In conclusion, these findings reveal cellular substrates and pathways regulated by the understudied Numb-associated kinase enzyme BIKE, a mechanism for CLINT1 regulation, and control of DENV infection via BIKE signaling, with potential implications for cell biology, virology, and host-targeted antiviral design.

Poly(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic polymers are currently considered ""gold-standard"" device coatings to reduce biofouling. To discover novel anti-biofouling materials, a combinatorial library of polyacrylamide-based copolymer hydrogels is created, and their ability is screened to prevent fouling from serum and platelet-rich plasma in a high-throughput parallel assay. It is found that certain nonintuitive copolymer compositions exhibit superior anti-biofouling properties over current gold-standard materials, and machine learning is used to identify key molecular features underpinning their performance. For validation, the surfaces of electrochemical biosensors are coated with hydrogels and their anti-biofouling performance in vitro and in vivo in rodent models is evaluated. The copolymer hydrogels preserve device function and enable continuous measurements of a small-molecule drug in vivo better than gold-standard coatings. The novel methodology described enables the discovery of anti-biofouling materials that can extend the lifetime of real-time in vivo sensing devices.

To address these limitations, we developed directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq), which uses antibody-tethered enzymes to methylate DNA near a target protein's binding sites in situ. These exogenous methylation marks are then detected simultaneously with endogenous CpG methylation on unamplified DNA using long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies. We optimized and benchmarked DiMeLo-seq by mapping chromatin-binding proteins and histone modifications across the human genome. Furthermore, we identified where centromere protein A localizes within highly repetitive regions that were unmappable with short sequencing reads, and we estimated the density of centromere protein A molecules along single chromatin fibers.

We measured the impact of 200 TP53 and KRAS variants on RNA profiles in over 300,000 single lung cancer cells, and used the profiles to categorize variants into phenotypic subsets to distinguish gain-of-function, loss-of-function and dominant negative variants, which we validated by comparison with orthogonal assays. We discovered that KRAS variants did not merely fit into discrete functional categories, but spanned a continuum of gain-of-function phenotypes, and that their functional impact could not have been predicted solely by their frequency in patient cohorts.

Our aim was to characterize early sepsis ex vivo functional immune response heterogeneity by studying whole blood endotoxin responses and derive a transcriptional metric of ex vivo endotoxin response.              Methods:                    Blood collected within 24 h of hospital presentation from 40 septic patients was divided into two fractions and incubated with media (unstimulated) or endotoxin. Supernatants and cells were isolated, and responses measured using: supernatant cytokines, lung endothelial permeability after supernatant exposure, and RNA expression. A transcriptomic signature was derived in unstimulated cells to predict the ex vivo endotoxin response. The signature was tested in a separate cohort of 191 septic patients to evaluate for association with clinical outcome. Plasma biomarkers were quantified to measure in vivo host inflammation.              Results:                    Ex vivo response to endotoxin varied and was unrelated to immunosuppression, white blood cell count, or the causative pathogen. Thirty-five percent of patients demonstrated a minimal response to endotoxin, suggesting early immunosuppression. High ex vivo cytokine production by stimulated blood cells correlated with increased in vitro pulmonary endothelial cell permeability and was associated with attenuated in vivo host inflammation. A four-gene signature of endotoxin response detectable without the need for a functional assay was identified. When tested in a separate cohort of septic patients, its expression was inversely associated with hospital mortality.

The identification of therapeutically relevant TCR-pMHC pairs is a significant bottleneck in the implementation of TCR-based immunotherapies but may be augmented by computational methodologies. The ability to computationally design TCRs to target a specific pMHC will require an automated integration of next-generation sequencing, protein-protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics (MD), and TCR ranking. We present a generic pipeline to evaluate patient-specific, sequence-based TCRs to a target pMHC. Using the three most frequently expressed TCRs from 16 colorectal cancer patients, we predicted the protein-protein structure of the TCRs to the target CEA peptide-MHC using Modeller and ColabFold. Then, these TCR-pMHC structures were compared by performing an automated molecular dynamics equilibration. ColabFold generates starting configurations that require, on average, a ~2.5X reduction in simulation time to equilibrate TCR-pMHC structures compared to Modeller. In addition, the structural differences between Modeller and ColabFold are demonstrated by an increase in root mean square deviation (~0.20 nm) between clusters of equilibrated configurations, which can impact the number of hydrogen bonds and Lennard-Jones contacts between the TCR and pMHC. Finally, we identify a TCR ranking criteria that may be used to prioritize TCRs for evaluation of in vitro immunogenicity.",,10.1101/2022.06.01.494331,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.01.494331v1,2022.06.01.494331,6/1/2022,,6/1/2022,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California; Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California","Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California; Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California",,,0.0,,

Almost three decades ago, Tonerand Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, orherds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of theToner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve thegoverning equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developedformalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scatteringobstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results toanalytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature,moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on avariety of landscapes.

However, despite technological advances2,3 most studies of allosteric effects on function are conducted in heterologous environments2,4,5, limiting the discovery of allosteric mechanisms that rely on endogenous binding partners or posttranslational modifications to modulate activity. Here we report an approach that enables probing of new sites of allosteric regulation at residue-level resolution in essential eukaryotic proteins in their native biological context by comprehensive mutational scanning. We apply our approach to the central GTPase Gsp1/Ran. GTPases are highly regulated molecular switches that control signaling, with switching occurring via catalyzed GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. We find that 28% of 4,315 assayed mutations in Gsp1/Ran are highly deleterious, showing a toxic response identified by our assay as gain-of-function (GOF). Remarkably, a third of all positions enriched for GOF mutations (20/60) are outside the GTPase active site. Kinetic analysis shows that these distal sites are allosterically coupled to the active site, including a novel cluster of sites that alter the nucleotide preference of Gsp1 from GDP to GTP. We describe multiple distinct mechanisms by which allosteric mutations alter Gsp1/Ran cellular function by modulating GTPase switching.

Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT), an incurable neurological disorder that disproportionately affects young girls2. Strategies to restore MeCP2 expression phenotypically reverse RTT-like symptoms in male and female MeCP2-deficient mice3–5, suggesting that direct nuclear delivery of functional MeCP2 could restore MeCP2 activity. We report that ZF-tMeCP2, a conjugate of MeCP2(Δaa13-71, 313-484)6 and the cell-permeant mini-protein ZF5.37–11, both binds DNA in a methylation-dependent manner and reaches the nucleus of model cell lines intact at concentrations above 700 nM. When delivered to live cells, ZF-tMeCP2 engages the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex and selectively represses transcription from methylated promoters. Efficient nuclear delivery of ZF-tMeCP2 relies on a unique endosomal escape portal provided by HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion. The Tat conjugate of MeCP2 (Tat-tMeCP2), evaluated for comparison, is degraded within the nucleus, is not selective for methylated promoters, and trafficks in a HOPS-independent manner.

A remarkable example of single-cell behavior is seen in the ciliate Lacrymaria olor, which hunts by striking its prey via rapid movements and protrusions of a slender neck, many times the size of the original cell body. This dynamics of the cell neck is powered by active injection of energy into this slender filamentous structure via a coat of cilia across its length and specialized cilia at the tip. How a cell can program this dynamical active filament to produce desirable behaviors like search and homing to a target remains unknown. By constructing a coupled active-elastic and hydrodynamic model of a slender filament with activity at the tip, here we uncover how cell behavior (filament shape dynamics) can be controlled via activity dynamics. Our model captures two key features of this system - dynamic activity patterns (extension and compression cycles) and active stresses that are uniquely aligned with the filament geometry - leading to a so-called “follower force” constraint. We show that active filaments under deterministic, time-varying follower forces display rich behaviors including periodic and aperiodic shape dynamics over long times. We further show that aperiodic dynamics occur due to a transition to chaos in regions of a biologically accessible parameter space. By further dissecting the non-linear dynamics of this active filament system, we discover a simple iterative map of filament shape that predicts long-term behavior. Lastly, using these iterative maps as a design tool, we demonstrate examples of how a cell could “program” filament behaviors by using frequency and amplitude modulated activity patterns. Overall, our results serve as a framework to mechanistically understand behavior in single cells such as L. olor and present a novel chaotic dynamical system in active elastohydrodynamics. Our work also offers a direct framework for designing programmable active matter systems using filament geometries.Significance statement Single-celled protozoa display remarkable animal-like behaviors without the aid of neurons. Mechanistically understanding how this dynamic behavior emerges from underlying physical and biochemical components is an outstanding challenge. In this work, using an active filament model, we uncover the fundamental non-linear dynamics and non-variational mechanics that underlie the complex behaviors of single cells like Lacrymaria olor. In doing so we discover a novel route to chaos in active elastohydrodynamic systems and the first-ever description of how chaos can drive single-cell behaviors. Lastly, we present a framework for how filament behaviors can be “programmed” using dynamic, modulated activity patterns.

For indirect-developing species, there are distinct larval and adult body plans that are linked together by metamorphosis. Some outstanding questions in the development of indirect-developing organisms include the extent to which larval tissue undergoes cell death during the process of metamorphosis and when and where the tissue that will give rise to the adult originates. How do the processes of cell division and cell death redesign the body plans of indirect developers? In this study, we present patterns of cell proliferation and cell death during larval body plan development, metamorphosis, and adult body plan formation, in the hemichordate Schizocardium californium (Cameron and Perez in Zootaxa 3569:79-88, 2012) to answer these questions.              Results:                    We identified distinct patterns of cell proliferation between larval and adult body plan formation of S. californicum. We found that some adult tissues proliferate during the late larval phase prior to the start of overt metamorphosis. In addition, using an irradiation and transcriptomic approach, we describe a genetic signature of proliferative cells that is shared across the life history states, as well as markers that are unique to larval or juvenile states. Finally, we observed that cell death is minimal in larval stages but begins with the onset of metamorphosis.              Conclusions:                    Cell proliferation during the development of S. californicum has distinct patterns in the formation of larval and adult body plans. However, cell death is very limited in larvae and begins during the onset of metamorphosis and into early juvenile development in specific domains. The populations of cells that proliferated and gave rise to the larvae and juveniles have a genetic signature that suggested a heterogeneous pool of proliferative progenitors, rather than a set-aside population of pluripotent cells. Taken together, we propose that the gradual morphological transformation of S. californicum is mirrored at the cellular level and may be more representative of the development strategies that characterize metamorphosis in many metazoan animals.

Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.              Methods:                    Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.              Results:                    Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.              Interpretation:                    Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.

Here we provide a detailed dissection of this using single-cell RNA-sequencing of 1.3M peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 120 individuals, longitudinally exposed to three different pathogens. These analyses indicate that cell-type-specificity is a more prominent factor than pathogen-specificity regarding contexts that affect how genetics influences gene expression (i.e., eQTL) and co-expression (i.e., co-expression QTL). In monocytes, the strongest responder to pathogen stimulations, 71.4% of the genetic variants whose effect on gene expression is influenced by pathogen exposure (i.e., response QTL) also affect the co-expression between genes. This indicates widespread, context-specific changes in gene expression level and its regulation that are driven by genetics. Pathway analysis on the CLEC12A gene that exemplifies cell-type-, exposure-time- and genetic-background-dependent co-expression interactions, shows enrichment of the interferon (IFN) pathway specifically at 3-h post-exposure in monocytes. Similar genetic background-dependent association between IFN activity and CLEC12A co-expression patterns is confirmed in systemic lupus erythematosus by in silico analysis, which implies that CLEC12A might be an IFN-regulated gene.

China was among the first countries to pledge supplies of the COVID-19 vaccine as a global public product, and to date, the country has provided more than 600 million vaccines to more than 200 countries and regions with low COVID-19 vaccination rates. Understanding the public's attitude in China toward the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines could inform global and national decisions, policies, and debates.              Objective:                    The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes of adults living in China regarding the global allocation of COVID-19 vaccines developed in China and how these attitudes vary across provinces and by sociodemographic characteristics.              Methods:                    We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among adults registered with the survey company KuRunData. The survey asked participants 31 questions about their attitudes regarding the global allocation of COVID-19 vaccines developed in China. We disaggregated responses by province and sociodemographic characteristics. All analyses used survey sampling weights.              Results:                    A total of 10,000 participants completed the questionnaire. Participants generally favored providing COVID-19 vaccines to foreign countries before fulfilling domestic needs (75.6%, 95% CI 74.6%-76.5%). Women (3778/4921, 76.8%; odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.32; P=.002) and those living in rural areas (3123/4065, 76.8%; odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.27; P=.03) were especially likely to hold this opinion. Most respondents preferred providing financial support through international platforms rather than directly offering support to individual countries (72.1%, 95% CI 71%-73.1%), while for vaccine products they preferred direct provision to relevant countries instead of via a delivery platform such as COVAX (77.3%, 95% CI 76.3%-78.2%).              Conclusions:                    Among our survey sample, we found that adults are generally supportive of the international distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which may encourage policy makers to support and implement the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines developed in China worldwide.

The uremic MDMs (uMDMs) phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), p-cresol sulfate (PCS), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulate during renal failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDM generation; however, it is unclear if inter-individual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here, we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals. During dietary homogeneity, the coefficient of variation in PAG, PCS, and IS (primary outcome) did not decrease, nor did inter-individual variation in most identified metabolites; other microbiome metrics showed no or modest responses to the intervention.

Using epidemiological models fit to a 19-year national dataset, we identified an overall trend of declining annual force of infection (FOI) for dengue virus (DENV) in Cambodia, interspersed with FOI spikes corresponding to epidemic year caseloads that exceeded demographic predictions. We constructed time-resolved phylogenetic trees with 105 DENV genomes sequenced from the 2019 Cambodian epidemic, paired with historical Southeast Asian data, to document the first-recorded introduction of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype into Cambodia. This introduction yielded highly localized transmission and decreased genomic diversity when compared to endemic DENV-1, supporting the hypothesis of epidemic invasion.

Dunn",biorxiv,Emergent Actin Flows Explain Diverse Parasite Gliding Modes,"SummaryDuring host infection, single-celled apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium and Toxoplasma use a motility mechanism called gliding, which differs fundamentally from other known mechanisms of eukaryotic cell motility. Gliding is thought to be powered by a thin layer of flowing filamentous (F)-actin1– 3 sandwiched between the plasma membrane and a myosin-coated4,5 inner membrane complex. How this surface actin layer drives the diverse apicomplexan gliding modes observed experimentally - helical, circular, and twirling6,7, and patch8, pendulum9, or rolling2 – presents a rich biophysical puzzle. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to track individual actin filaments and myosin complexes in live Toxoplasma gondii. Based on these data, we hypothesize that F-actin flows arise by self-organization, rather than following a microtubule-based template as previously believed. We develop a continuum model of emergent F-actin flow within the unusual confines provided by parasite geometry. In the presence of F-actin turnover, our model predicts the emergence of a steady-state mode in which actin transport is largely rearward. Removing actin turnover leads to actin patches that recirculate up and down the cell, a “cyclosis” that we observe experimentally for drug-stabilized actin bundles in live parasites. These findings provide a mechanism by which actin turnover governs a transition between distinct self-organized F-actin states, whose properties can account for the diverse gliding modes known to occur. More broadly, we illustrate how different forms of gliding motility can emerge as an intrinsic consequence of the self-organizing properties of F-actin flow in a confined geometry.",,10.1101/2022.06.08.495399,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495399v1,2022.06.08.495399,6/9/2022,,6/9/2022,"Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University; Dept. of Physics, California Institute of Technology; Div. of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University; Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University; Dept. of Physics, California Institute of Technology; Div. of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University",,,0.0,,

While some cell size control mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated through studies of cultured cells, it is unclear if and how such mechanisms control cell size in an animal. For example, it was recently shown that RB, the retinoblastoma protein, was diluted by cell growth in G1 to promote size-dependence of the G1/S transition. However, it remains unclear to what extent the RB-dilution mechanism controls cell size in an animal. We therefore examined the contribution of RB-dilution to cell size control in the mouse liver. The RB-dilution model has two requirements. First, manipulations changing RB concentration drive corresponding changes in cell size, and second, the endogenous RB concentration decreases with cell size in G1. We found that both these requirements were met. Genetic perturbations decreasing RB protein concentrations through inducible shRNA expression or through liverspecific Rb1 knockout reduced hepatocyte size, while perturbations increasing RB protein concentrations in an Fah−/− mouse model increased hepatocyte size. Moreover, RB concentration decreased in larger G1 hepatocytes while the concentrations of the cell cycle activators Cyclin D1 and E2f1 remained relatively constant. Lastly, we tested how Rb1 manipulations affected G1/S cell size control in primary hepatocytes using live cell imaging. Loss of Rb1 weakened cell size control, i.e., reduced the inverse correlation between how much cells grew in G1 and how large they were at birth. Taken together, our results show that an RB- dilution mechanism contributes to cell size control in the mouse liver by linking cell growth to the G1/S transition.",,10.1101/2022.06.08.495371,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495371v1,2022.06.08.495371,6/10/2022,,6/10/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University","Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University; Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

How TMEM95 plays a role in membrane fusion of sperm and eggs has remained elusive. Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino-acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for a specific, receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs and suggest that this interaction may have a role in facilitating membrane fusion.Significance statement Membrane fusion of sperm and eggs is pivotal in sexual reproduction. Tmem95 knockout mice show male-specific sterility, but it was unknown how sperm TMEM95 facilitates membrane fusion with eggs. We show here that human TMEM95 binds eggs. Our crystal structure of TMEM95 suggests a region where this binding may occur. We develop monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that impair sperm-egg fusion but do not block sperm-egg binding. Thus, we propose that there is a receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs, and that this interaction may have a direct role in membrane fusion.

APOBEC3 enzymes can act as potent host genome mutagens in multiple cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)3,4. There are seven human APOBEC3 family members (APOBEC3A-H) and all but one (G) preferentially deaminate TC dinucleotide substrates3. In patients, both APOBEC3A (A3A)5 and APOBEC3B (A3B)6 have been implicated to play a major role in NSCLC3. In this study, the impact of A3B on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancer evolution was assessed. EGFR mutant NSCLC mouse models containing a human A3B transgene7 were generated, and the effect of enforced A3B expression was evaluated at multiple timepoints. Enforced A3B expression was detrimental to tumour initiation and progression in the absence of targeted therapy due to elevated chromosomal instability (CIN) and p53 activation, which increased significantly in tumours with A3B expression. This finding was substantiated in the TRACERx421 study demonstrating a significant correlation between CIN and A3B in patients with NSCLC. In contrast, A3B expression with targeted therapy resulted in a significant increase in treatment resistance in mouse models and human preclinical models of EGFR mutant lung cancer. In specimens collected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma, targeted therapy upregulated A3B expression, and induced significantly more APOBEC-associated mutations including variants associated with therapy resistance. Analyses of human NSCLC models revealed that targeted therapy induced A3B upregulation in part via treatment-mediated activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signalling, and downregulation of the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG).

Molecular mimicry empowers pathogens to subvert critical host processes and establish infection. We report that the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila secretes the toxin SidI (substrate of icm/dot transporter I), which possesses a transfer RNA (tRNA)-like shape and functions as a mannosyl transferase. The 3.1 Å cryo-EM structure of SidI reveals an N-terminal domain that exhibits a characteristic ‘inverted L-shape’ and charge distribution that is present in two other known protein mimics of tRNAs, the bacterial elongation factor EF-G and the mammalian release factor eRF1. In addition, we show that SidI’s C-terminal domain adopts a glycosyl transferase B fold similar to a mannosyl transferase. This molecular coupling of the protein’s fold and enzymatic function allows SidI to bind and glycosylate components of the host translation apparatus, including the ribosome, resulting in a robust block of protein synthesis that is comparable in potency to ricin, one of the most powerful toxins known. Additionally, we find that translational pausing activated by SidI elicits a stress response signature reminiscent of the ribotoxic stress response that is activated by elongation inhibitors that induce ribosome collisions. SidI-mediated effects on the ribosome activate the stress kinases ZAKα and p38, which in turn drive an accumulation of the protein activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Intriguingly, ATF3 escapes the translation block imposed by SidI, translocates to the nucleus, and orchestrates the transcription of stress-inducible genes that promote cell death. Thus, using Legionella and its effectors as tools, we have unravelled the role of a ribosome-to-nuclear signalling pathway that regulates cell fate.",,10.1101/2022.06.10.495705,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.10.495705v3,2022.06.10.495705,6/12/2022,,6/12/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California at San Francisco; Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California at San Francisco; Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California at San Francisco; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California at San Francisco; G.W.

We therefore developed a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise, or hardware. Our approach is based on pre-templated instant partitions (PIPs) that allow single cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions with only a vortexer. PIP-seq accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse-human mixing studies, is compatible with multi-omics measurements, and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue when compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq revealed the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy resistant cell subsets that was hidden by standard immunophenotyping.

Although microelectrodes have been developed for long-term electrophysiological interfaces with neural tissue, studies of long-term interfaces between microelectrodes and free-floating organoids remain limited. In this study, we report a stretchable, soft mesh electrode system that establishes an intimate in vitro electrical interface with human neurons in 3D organoids. Our mesh is constructed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based electrically conductive hydrogel electrode arrays and an elastomeric poly(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (SEBS) as the substrate and encapsulation materials. This mesh electrode can maintain stable electrochemical impedance in buffer solution under 50% compressive and 50% tensile strain. We have successfully cultured pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical organoids (hCO) on this polymeric mesh for more than 3 months and demonstrated that organoids readily integrate with the mesh. Using simultaneous stimulation and calcium imaging, we show that electrical stimulation through the mesh can elicit intensity-dependent calcium signals comparable to stimulation from a bipolar stereotrode.

Current computational methods identify and measure the spatial relationships between cell-types, but do not leverage the spatial information of individual RNA molecules to reveal subcellular spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA processing. Here, we developed Bento, a computational framework for subcellular analysis of high-throughput spatial transcriptomics datasets. Bento handles single-molecule data generated by diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies and computes spatial statistics of subcellular RNA molecular distributions, compartmental expression, and cell morphology to build multidimensional feature sets for exploratory analysis. We also developed a multi-label ensemble model for generalizable classification of subcellular localization of every gene in every cell. To demonstrate Bento’s utility, we applied it to analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by seqFISH+ (10k genes in ∼200 fibroblast cells) and MERFISH (130 genes quantified in ∼1000 U2-OS cells) to understand the interplay between gene function, cellular morphology and RNA localization. To understand the role of RNA localization in RNA processing, we integrated spatial data with RNA binding protein (RBP) binding data to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of RBP-RNA interactions at unprecedented scale (3,165 RNA species x 148 RBPs). We found RNA targets of individual RBPs to be enriched in specific subcellular compartments – such as Splicing Factor 3a Protein Complex (SF3A3), and that preferential localization is influenced by RBP binding of genomic regions for RBPs including Staufen homolog 2 (STAU2). Bento builds on the existing ecosystem of single-cell and spatial analysis toolkits, to ensure accessibility and community-driven tool development. We provide Bento as an open-source tool for the community to further expand our understanding of subcellular biology.",,10.1101/2022.06.10.495510,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.10.495510v1,2022.06.10.495510,6/13/2022,,6/13/2022,"Center for Epigenomics, University of California San Diego; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego; Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego; Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California San Diego; Stem Cell Program, University of California San Diego","Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego; Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego; Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego; Center for Epigenomics, University of California San Diego; Center for Epigenomics, University of California San Diego; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Pathology, Stanford University; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub; Center for Epigenomics, University of California San Diego; Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego; Stem Cell Program, University of California San Diego; Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California San Diego",,,0.0,,

Pre-existing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) neutralizing type I IFNs underlie at least 15% of critical COVID-19 pneumonia cases in unvaccinated individuals; however, their contribution to hypoxemic breakthrough cases in vaccinated people remains unknown. Here, we studied a cohort of 48 individuals (age 20-86 years) who received 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine and developed a breakthrough infection with hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia 2 weeks to 4 months later. Antibody levels to the vaccine, neutralization of the virus, and auto-Abs to type I IFNs were measured in the plasma. Forty-two individuals had no known deficiency of B cell immunity and a normal antibody response to the vaccine. Among them, ten (24%) had auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs (aged 43-86 years). Eight of these ten patients had auto-Abs neutralizing both IFN-α2 and IFN-ω, while two neutralized IFN-ω only. No patient neutralized IFN-β. Seven neutralized 10 ng/mL of type I IFNs, and three 100 pg/mL only. Seven patients neutralized SARS-CoV-2 D614G and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) efficiently, while one patient neutralized Delta slightly less efficiently. Two of the three patients neutralizing only 100 pg/mL of type I IFNs neutralized both D61G and Delta less efficiently.

These applications require stable, uniform droplets with predictable microreactor volumes. However, predicting DE droplet size, shell thickness, and stability as a function of flow rate has remained challenging for monodisperse single core droplets and those containing biologically-relevant buffers, which influence bulk and interfacial properties. As a result, developing novel DE-based bioassays has typically required extensive initial optimization of flow rates to find conditions that produce stable droplets of the desired size and shell thickness. To address this challenge, we conducted systematic size parameterization quantifying how differences in flow rates and buffer properties (viscosity and interfacial tension at water/oil interfaces) alter droplet size and stability, across 6 inner aqueous buffers used across applications such as cellular lysis, microbial growth, and drug delivery, quantifying the size and shell thickness of >22 000 droplets overall. We restricted our study to stable single core droplets generated in a 2-step dripping-dripping formation regime in a straightforward PDMS device. Using data from 138 unique conditions (flow rates and buffer composition), we also demonstrated that a recent physically-derived size law of Wang et al. can accurately predict double emulsion shell thickness for >95% of observations. Finally, we validated the utility of this size law by using it to accurately predict droplet sizes for a novel bioassay that requires encapsulating growth media for bacteria in droplets. This work has the potential to enable new screening-based biological applications by simplifying novel DE bioassay development.",35593127.0,10.1039/d2lc00229a.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9195911/,,,6/14/2022,6/14/2022,"1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.2 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. pfordyce@stanford.edu.3 ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.4 School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, MA - 01234, USA.5 School of Energy & Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China.6 Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.7 Department of Physics, Durham University, Durham DH1 3LE, UK.8 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.9 Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.",,,2022 Jun 14;22(12):2315-2330.,0.0,,

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike trimer (S) constitute the two major neutralizing targets for antibodies. Here, we use NTD-specific probes to capture anti-NTD memory B cells in a longitudinal cohort of infected individuals, some of whom were vaccinated. We found 6 complementation groups of neutralizing antibodies. 58% targeted epitopes outside the NTD supersite, 58% neutralized either Gamma or Omicron, and 14% were broad neutralizers that also neutralized Omicron. Structural characterization revealed that broadly active antibodies targeted three epitopes outside the NTD supersite including a class that recognized both the NTD and SD2 domain. Rapid recruitment of memory B cells producing these antibodies into the plasma cell compartment upon re-infection likely contributes to the relatively benign course of subsequent infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron.

However, these heterologous enzymes can suffer from low activity, specificity, stability and solubility in yeast, resulting in arduous iterations of design-build-test-learn cycles to optimize their production often performed on a single enzyme basis. Laboratory directed evolution has proven to be a powerful and high-throughput method for protein engineering, albeit its limited application for biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we harness small molecule-sensing, RNA-based switches to develop a generalizable selection system facilitating enzyme evolution. Our design utilizes an RNA-based switch for detection of intracellular compound production, which then regulates the expression of a selection gene. Our initial data shows that the auxotrophy selection gene SpHIS5 exhibits the highest selective capability in combination with a theophylline-responsive RNA-based switch. Using the theophylline-responsive RNA-based switch, we demonstrated the enrichment of a high-producing variant of caffeine demethylase, in a population size of 103. We target to demonstrate the use of this RNA-based selection system as a general approach for enzyme evolution.",,10.1101/2022.06.14.496130,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.14.496130v1,2022.06.14.496130,6/15/2022,,6/15/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Here we found in fruit fly embryos that the cytoplasm can compartmentalize and divide without nuclei. Our targeted screen for potential necessary and sufficient conditions revealed that, although the cytoplasmic compartments are tightly associated with centrosomes, they can form without astral microtubules and divide without centrioles. Although a focal pool of microtubules is necessary for maintaining cytoplasmic compartments, this is not sufficient for their initial formation. Actin filaments are similarly an essential component of cytoplasmic compartments; however, their myosin II-based contractility is unexpectedly dispensable for divisions. We show that the myosin II-based contractility is instead involved in regulating the pace of these divisions. Importantly, our results revealed that the cytoplasmic divisions without nuclei can occur in a periodic manner autonomously of the Cdk-Cyclin oscillator that normally drives the cell cycle. We demonstrate that such autonomy of cytoplasmic divisions is preserved even in normal development, where it is leveraged to extrude mitotically delayed nuclei from the blastoderm, protecting the synchrony of rapid nuclear divisions against local delays in mitotic entry. We propose that an active coordination between otherwise autonomous cycles of cytoplasmic and nuclear divisions acts as a quality control mechanism for genome integrity and partitioning in development.",,10.1101/2022.06.15.496343,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.15.496343v1,2022.06.15.496343,6/16/2022,,6/16/2022,"Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Science, University of California","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Science, University of California; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Science, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California; Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California",,,0.0,,

We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with controls using a specific Radioligand Binding Assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17/46; 37%) particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity.

Marshall",biorxiv,"Modular, Cascade-like Transcriptional Program of Regeneration in Stentor","The giant ciliate Stentor coeruleus is a classical model system for studying regeneration and morphogenesis at the level of a single cell. The anterior of the cell is marked by an array of cilia, known as the oral apparatus, which can be induced to shed and regenerate in a series of reproducible morphological steps, previously shown to require transcription. If a cell is cut in half, each half will regenerate an intact cell, including a new oral apparatus in the posterior half. We used RNAseq to assay the dynamic changes in Stentor’s transcriptome during regeneration, after both oral apparatus shedding and bisection, allowing us to identify distinct temporal waves of gene expression including kinases, RNA binding proteins, centriole biogenesis factors, and orthologs of human ciliopathy genes implicated in Meckel and Joubert syndromes. By comparing transcriptional profiles of different regeneration events in the same species, we were able to identify distinct modules of gene expression corresponding to oral apparatus regeneration, posterior holdfast regeneration, and recovery after wounding. By measuring gene expression in cells in which translation is blocked, we show that the sequential waves of gene expression involve a cascade mechanism in which later waves of expression are triggered by translation products of early-expressed genes. Among the early-expressed genes, we identified an E2F transcription factor and the conserved RNA binding protein Pumilio as potential regulators of regeneration based on the expression pattern of their predicted target genes. RNAi mediated knockdown experiments indicate that Pumilio is required for regenerating oral structures of the correct size. We show that E2F is involved in the completion of regeneration but is dispensable for earlier steps. This work allows us to classify regeneration genes into groups based on their potential role for regeneration in distinct cell regeneration paradigms, and provides insight into how a single cell can coordinate complex morphogenetic pathways to regenerate missing structures.",,10.1101/2021.06.23.449623,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.23.449623v3,2021.06.23.449623,6/19/2022,,6/19/2022,Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California,Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California,,,0.0,,

While we know nearly all mammalian kinetochore proteins, how these give rise to the strong yet dynamic microtubule attachments required for function remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the Astrin-SKAP complex, which localizes to bioriented kinetochores and is essential for chromosome segregation but whose mechanical role is unclear. Live imaging reveals that SKAP depletion dampens the movement and decreases the coordination of metaphase sister kinetochores and increases the tension between them. Using laser ablation to isolate kinetochores bound to polymerizing versus depolymerizing microtubules, we show that without SKAP, kinetochores move slower on both polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules and that more force is needed to rescue microtubules to polymerize. Thus, in contrast to the previously described kinetochore proteins that increase the grip on microtubules under force, Astrin-SKAP reduces the grip, increasing attachment dynamics and force responsiveness and reducing friction.

Here, we performed a single-nucleus study of the adult Drosophila renal system, consisting of Malpighian tubules and nephrocytes, which shares similarities with the mammalian kidney. We identified 11 distinct clusters representing renal stem cells, stellate cells, regionally specific principal cells, garland nephrocyte cells, and pericardial nephrocytes. Characterization of the transcription factors specific to each cluster identified fruitless (fru) as playing a role in stem cell regeneration and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4) in regulating glycogen and triglyceride metabolism. In addition, we identified a number of genes, including Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor at 64C (RhoGEF64c), Frequenin 2 (Frq2), Prip, and CG1093 that are involved in regulating the unusual star shape of stellate cells. Importantly, the single-nucleus dataset allows visualization of the expression at the organ level of genes involved in ion transport and junctional permeability, providing a systems-level view of the organization and physiological roles of the tubules. Finally, a cross-species analysis allowed us to match the fly kidney cell types to mouse kidney cell types and planarian protonephridia, knowledge that will help the generation of kidney disease models.

Here, we interrogated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate NK cell recognition and lysis of infected cells. We found that NK cells exhibit poor cytotoxic responses against SARS-CoV-2-infected targets, preferentially killing uninfected bystander cells. We demonstrate that this escape is driven by downregulation of ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D (“NKG2D-L”). Indeed, early in viral infection, prior to NKG2D-L downregulation, NK cells are able to target and kill infected cells; however, this ability is lost as viral proteins are expressed. Finally, we found that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) mediates downregulation of NKG2D-L and that Nsp1 alone is sufficient to confer resistance to NK cell killing. Collectively, our work reveals that SARS-CoV-2 evades NK cell cytotoxicity and describes a mechanism by which this occurs.Download figureOpen in new tab",,10.1101/2022.06.20.496341,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.496341v1,2022.06.20.496341,6/21/2022,,6/21/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Statistics, Stanford University; Sarafan Chem-H, Stanford University; Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine","Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Statistics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Sarafan Chem-H, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

Here, we characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in a longitudinal cohort of 109 COVID-19 outpatients enrolled during acute infection. The quality of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ response shifts from cells producing interferon gamma (IFNγ) to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) from 5 days to 4 months post-enrollment, with IFNγ-IL-21-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells the predominant population detected at later time points. Greater percentages of IFNγ-IL-21-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells on day 28 correlate with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies measured 7 months post-infection (⍴ = 0.4, p = 0.01). mRNA vaccination following SARS-CoV-2 infection boosts both IFNγ- and TNF-α-producing, spike-protein-specific CD4+ T cells.

We investigated immunophenotypes and cell-specific genes associated with disease activity using multiplexed RNA and protein single-cell sequencing applied to PBMCs from 4 treatment-naïve JDM (TN-JDM) subjects at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months post-treatment and 4 subjects with inactive disease on treatment. Analysis of 55,564 cells revealed separate clustering of TN-JDM cells within monocyte, NK, CD8+ effector T and naïve B populations. The proportion of CD16+ monocytes was reduced in TN-JDM, and naïve B cells and CD4+ Tregs were expanded. Cell-type differential gene expression analysis and hierarchical clustering identified a pan-cell-type IFN gene signature over-expressed in TN-JDM in all cell types and correlated with disease activity most strongly in cytotoxic cell types. TN-JDM CD16+ monocytes expressed the highest IFN gene score and were highly skewed toward an inflammatory and antigen-presenting phenotype at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. A transitional B cell population with a distinct transcriptomic signature was expanded in TN-JDM and characterized by higher CD24 and CD5 proteins and less CD39, an immunoregulatory protein.

Interestingly, actin does not assemble at all CME sites in mammalian cells. How actin networks are organized with respect to mammalian CME sites and how assembly forces are harnessed, are not fully understood. Here, branched actin network geometry at CME sites was analyzed using three different advanced imaging approaches. When endocytic dynamics of unperturbed CME sites are compared, sites with actin assembly show a distinct signature, a delay between completion of coat expansion and vesicle scission, indicating that actin assembly occurs preferentially at stalled CME sites. In addition, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are recruited to one side of CME sites, where they are positioned to stimulate asymmetric actin assembly and force production. We propose that actin assembles preferentially at stalled CME sites where it pulls vesicles into the cell asymmetrically, much as a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap.",35732852.0,10.1038/s41467-022-31207-5.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9217951/,,,6/22/2022,6/22/2022,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.4 Department of Pharmacology, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.5 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. drubin@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Jun 22;13(1):3578.,0.0,,

To inform Lesotho’s national rollout of PrEP to the general population, this research aimed to characterize knowledge and attitudes towards PrEP among policy makers, implementing partners, healthcare providers, and PrEP end-users in Lesotho. Respondents were purposively selected to participate based on personal experience in the development and implementation of Lesotho’s PrEP program, or the personal use of PrEP. We conducted 106 in-depth interviews with policy makers (n=5), implementing partners (n=4), and end-users (current PrEP users = 55; former PrEP users = 36; and PrEP “decliners” = 6). In addition, we held 11 focus group discussions (FGDs) with a total of 105 healthcare providers. Interview and FGD transcripts were analyzed following the tenets of Grounded Theory. Respondents expressed positive attitudes towards PrEP, owing to experienced and perceived personal, familial, and societal benefits. PrEP was viewed as i) an opportunity for serodiscordant couples to remain together, ii) a means of conceiving children with minimized risk of HIV infection, iii) providing a sense of agency and control, and iv) an avenue for addressing the HIV epidemic in Lesotho. Respondents demonstrated understanding of PrEP’s intended use, eligibility requirements, and modality of use. However, they also reported that several important misconceptions of PrEP were common among adults in Lesotho, including the belief that PrEP protects against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, promotes promiscuity, prevents pregnancy, causes seroconversion, and provides lifelong protection from taking the pill just once. In addition to building on the perceived advantages of PrEP to shape a positive message, Lesotho’s national rollout of PrEP will likely benefit from a communication strategy that specifically addresses the common misconceptions of PrEP identified in this study.",,10.1101/2022.06.21.22276722,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/06/22/2022.06.21.22276722,2022.06.21.22276722,6/22/2022,,6/22/2022,"Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI); Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Clinton Health Access Initiative – Lesotho Country Office; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host.

An open question is whether these sex differences reflect men's generally poorer health and lower life expectancy compared to women of similar ages or if men face a unique COVID-19 disadvantage. Using age-specific data on COVID-19 mortality as well as cause-specific and all-cause mortality for 63 countries, we compared the sex difference in COVID-19 mortality to sex differences in all-cause mortality and mortality from other common causes of death to determine the magnitude of the excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19. We found that sex differences in the age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rate were substantially larger than for the age-standardized all-cause mortality rate and mortality rate for most other common causes of death. The excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19 was especially large in the oldest age groups. Our findings suggest that the causal pathways that link male sex to a higher mortality from a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be specific to SARS-CoV-2, rather than shared with the pathways responsible for the shorter life expectancy among men or sex differences for other common causes of death.

A recently discovered novel family of lipid transfer proteins, which includes the VPS13 proteins (VPS13A-D), adopt a rod-like bridge conformation with an extended hydrophobic groove that enables the bulk transfer of membrane lipids for membrane growth.

VPS13A and VPS13C localize to multiple organelle contact sites, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) – lipid droplet (LD) contact sites, but the functional roles of these proteins in LD regulation remains mostly unexplored.

A systematic understanding of host factors influencing viral infection is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in murine models.

These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the near-complete 16,740 nt genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses—HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)—but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the virus’s potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover.Importance Henipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus which likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.",,10.1101/2022.06.12.495793,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.12.495793v2,2022.06.12.495793,6/24/2022,,6/24/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago; Department of Entomology, University of Antananarivo; Department of Medicine and Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California; Virology Department, Institut Pasteur de Dakar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar","Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Department of Entomology, University of Antananarivo; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine and Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Department, Institut Pasteur de Dakar; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago",,,0.0,Now published in J Virol 10.1128/jvi.00921-22.,7

When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.

Almost three decades ago, Toner and Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, or herds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challenge faced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is the complex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic and microscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grass plains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problems analytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of the Toner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve the governing equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developed formalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scattering obstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results to analytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature, moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on a variety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients and dynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatile incorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps of parameter space. Looking forward, the work presented here lays the groundwork for a dialogue between Toner-Tu theory and data on collective motion in biologically-relevant geometries, from drone footage of migrating animal herds to movies of microscopic cytoskeletal flows within cells.",,10.1101/2022.06.22.497052,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.22.497052v1,2022.06.22.497052,6/25/2022,,6/25/2022,"Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Physics, California Institute of Technology; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology","Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Physics, California Institute of Technology; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology",,,0.0,,

Towards this goal, we deployed a customized P. falciparum PhIP-seq T7 phage display library containing 238,068 tiled 62-amino acid peptides, covering all known coding regions, including antigenic variants, to systematically profile antibody targets in 198 Ugandan children and adults from high and moderate transmission settings. Repeat elements – short amino acid sequences repeated within a protein – were significantly enriched in antibody targets. While breadth of responses to repeat-containing peptides was twofold higher in children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting, no such differences were observed for peptides without repeats, suggesting that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions may be more exposure dependent and/or less durable in children than responses to regions without repeats. Additionally, short motifs associated with seroreactivity were extensively shared among hundreds of antigens, potentially representing cross- reactive epitopes. PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens, partly driven by the diversity of PfEMP1 sequences. These data suggest that the large number of repeat elements and potential cross-reactive epitopes found within antigenic regions of P. falciparum could contribute to the inefficient nature of malaria immunity.",,10.1101/2022.06.24.497532,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.497532v1,2022.06.24.497532,6/26/2022,,6/26/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Redwood City; Infectious Disease Research Collaboration; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of California Berkeley; University of California San Francisco","University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Redwood City; University of California Berkeley; University of California San Francisco; University of California San Francisco; University of California San Francisco; University of California San Francisco; Infectious Disease Research Collaboration; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Infectious Disease Research Collaboration; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

The parasite evades clearance by the host immune system through antigenic variation of its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, periodically “switching” expression of the VSG using a large genomic repertoire of VSG-encoding genes. Studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream, but recent work has shown that many, if not most, parasites are extravascular and reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues. However, it is unknown whether parasites undergo antigenic variation while in extravascular spaces. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Our experiments show that the expressed VSG repertoire is not uniform across populations of parasites within the same infection and that a greater number of VSGs are expressed in tissue spaces than in the blood. More than 75% of the VSGs detected in an animal were found exclusively within extravascular spaces. Interestingly, we also noticed a delay in the VSG-specific clearance of parasites in tissue spaces compared to the blood. This finding aligns with a model in which parasites “hide” from the immune system in tissue spaces, where a slower immune response provides them with more time to generate new antigenic variants. Overall, our results show that extravascular spaces are significant reservoirs of VSG diversity, potentially resulting from delayed clearance of tissue-resident parasites.",,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497797v1,2022.06.27.497797,6/27/2022,,6/27/2022,"Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Neuroscience, Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, Berkeley Public Health Molecular and Cell Biology Department; Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa","Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Neuroscience, Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, Berkeley Public Health Molecular and Cell Biology Department; Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health",,,0.0,,

Microbial pangenomes are created by aggregating all genomes of a single clade and reflect the metabolic diversity of groups of organisms. As de novo metagenome analysis techniques have matured and reference genome databases have expanded, metapangenome analysis has risen in popularity as a tool to organize the functional potential of organisms in relation to the environment from which those organisms were sampled. However, the reliance on assembly and binning or on reference databases often leaves substantial portions of metagenomes unanalyzed, thereby underestimating the functional potential of a community. To address this challenge, we present a method for metapangenomics that relies on amino acid k-mers (kaa-mers) and metagenome assembly graph queries. To enable this method, we first show that kaa-mers estimate pangenome characteristics and that open reading frames can be accurately predicted from short shotgun sequencing reads using the previously developed tool orpheum. These techniques enable pangenomics to be performed directly on short sequencing reads. To enable metapangenome analysis, we combine these approaches with compact de Bruijn assembly graph queries to directly generate sets of sequencing reads for a specific species from a metagenome.

Our analysis suggests that the transcription factor Neurog3 may act as a pioneer transcription factor to specify the pancreatic endocrine lineage. These findings could improve protocols to generate replacement endocrine cells from renewable sources, like stem cells, for diabetes therapy.

However, our understanding of LCMV and its interactions with human host factors remains incomplete. Here, host determinants affecting LCMV infection were investigated through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in A549 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma line. We identified and validated a variety of novel host factors that play a functional role in LCMV infection. Among these, knockout of the sialomucin CD164, a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein, was found to ablate infection with multiple LCMV strains but not other hemorrhagic mammarenaviruses in several cell types. Further characterization revealed a dependency of LCMV entry on the cysteine-rich domain of CD164, including an N-linked glycosylation site at residue 104 in that region. Given the documented role of LCMV with respect to transplacental human infections, CD164 expression was investigated in human placental tissue and placental cell lines. CD164 was found to be highly expressed in the cytotrophoblast cells, an initial contact site for pathogens within the placenta, and LCMV infection in placental cells was effectively blocked using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cysteine-rich domain of CD164. Together, this study identifies novel factors associated with LCMV infection of human tissues and highlights the importance of CD164, a sialomucin that previously had not been associated with viral infection. IMPORTANCE Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a human-pathogenic mammarenavirus that can be fatal in congenital infections. Although frequently used in the study of persistent infections in the field of immunology, aspects of this virus's life cycle remain incomplete. For example, while viral entry has been shown to depend on a cell adhesion molecule, DAG1, genetic knockout of this gene allows for residual viral infection, implying that additional receptors can mediate cell entry. The significance of our study is the identification of host factors important for successful infection, including the sialomucin CD164, which had not been previously associated with viral infection. We demonstrated that CD164 is essential for LCMV entry into human cells and can serve as a possible therapeutic target for treatment of congenital infection.

Whether ferroptosis sensitivity is governed by a single regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, based on the integration of 24 published chemical genetic screens combined with targeted follow-up experimentation, we find that the genetic regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity is highly variable and context-dependent. For example, the lipid metabolic gene acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) appears far more essential for ferroptosis triggered by direct inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) than by cystine deprivation. Despite this, distinct pro-ferroptotic stimuli converge upon a common lethal effector mechanism: accumulation of lipid peroxides at the plasma membrane. These results indicate that distinct genetic mechanisms regulate ferroptosis sensitivity, with implications for the initiation and analysis of this process in vivo.

Unfortunately, these biosensors often suffer from cross-reactivity problems when measuring a target in samples containing other chemically similar molecules, such as precursors or metabolites. While some progress has been made in selecting highly specific aptamers, the discovery of these reagents remains slow and costly. In this work, we demonstrate a novel strategy to distinguish molecules with miniscule difference in chemical composition (such as a single hydroxyl group) – with cross reactive aptamer probes - by tuning the charge state of the surface on which the aptamer probes are immobilized. As an exemplar, we show that our strategy can distinguish between DOX and many structurally similar analytes, including its primary metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol). We then demonstrate the ability to accurately quantify mixtures of these two molecules based on their differential response to sensors with different surface-charge properties.

Although the number of e-cigarette users has been increasing, the potential health impacts and biological effects of e-cigarettes are still not fully understood. Previous research has focused on the biological effects of e-cigarettes on lung cancer cell lines and distal airway epithelial cells; however, there have been few published studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on primary lung alveolar epithelial cells. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effect of e-cigarette aerosol on primary human lung alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, both alone and in the presence of viral infection. The Melo-3 atomizer caused direct AT2 cell toxicity, whereas the more popular Juul pod's aerosol did not have a detectable cytotoxic effect on AT2 cells. Juul nicotine aerosol also did not increase short-term susceptibility to viral infection. However, 3 days of exposure upregulated genes central to the generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carcinogen metabolism and downregulated key innate immune system genes related to cytokine and chemokine signaling. These findings have implications for the potentially injurious impact of long-term use of popular low-power e-cigarette pods on the human alveolar epithelium. Gene expression data might be an important endpoint for evaluating the potential harmful effects of vaping devices that do not cause overt toxicity.

This complexity underlies the incomplete understanding of the genetic architecture of congenital heart diseases (CHDs). To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of cardiac cellular development, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of human fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each associated with dynamic transcription factor (TF) activity signatures. We identified similarities and differences of regulatory landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and their in vivo counterparts. We interpreted deep learning models that predict cell-type resolved, base-resolution chromatin accessibility profiles from DNA sequence to decipher underlying TF motif lexicons and infer the regulatory impact of non-coding variants. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched in CHD cases versus controls. We used CRISPR-based perturbations to validate an enhancer harboring a nominated regulatory CHD mutation, linking it to effects on the expression of a known CHD gene JARID2.

Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.",35584773.0,10.1038/s41586-022-04865-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9279157/,,5/18/2022,22-Jul,7/1/2022,"1 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.7 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Michael Hulton Center for HIV Cure Research at Gladstone, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Curative Inc., San Dimas, CA, USA.11 Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.12 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.13 Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.14 Department of Anesthesia, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.15 California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.16 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.17 Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. nadia.roan@gladstone.ucsf.edu.18 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.19 UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.20 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.21 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.22 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. charles.chiu@ucsf.edu.23 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.24 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.25 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.26 Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.27 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.28 Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.29 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. doudna@berkeley.edu.30 Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.31 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.32 Quantitative Biosciences Institute COVID-19 Research Group, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.33 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. melanie.ott@gladstone.ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul;607(7918):351-355.,0.0,,

Case 2 had a remote history of breast adenocarcinoma and presented with gait instability, distal lower extremity numbness, and paresthesias that progressed to generalized weakness. CSF and serum from both patients immunostained the axon initial segment (AIS) and node of Ranvier (NoR) of mice and enriched βIV-spectrin by PhIP-Seq. Patient CSF and serum failed to immunostain NoRs in dorsal root sensory neurons from βI/βIV-deficient mice. βIV-spectrin autoantibodies were confirmed by overexpression of AIS and nodal βIV-spectrin isoforms Σ1 and Σ6 by a cell-based assay. βIV-spectrin was not enriched in a combined 4,815 PhIP-Seq screens of healthy and other neurologic disease patients.

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency. This study sheds light on the role of co-occurring genetic alterations and on the effect of splicing factor deficiency on the modulation of sensitivity to targeted kinase inhibitor cancer therapy.

A key component to this is that global transcription rates increase in larger cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we identify RNAPII as the major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size in budding yeast as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the general transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content. This drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is precisely compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge. Thus, limiting RNAPII and feedback on mRNA stability work in concert to ensure mRNA concentration homeostasis in growing cells.",,10.1101/2021.09.20.461005,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.20.461005v2,2021.09.20.461005,7/1/2022,,7/1/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biology, McGill University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; The Francis Crick Institute","Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Biology, McGill University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; The Francis Crick Institute; The Francis Crick Institute; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Biology, McGill University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Some of the most frequently activated oncogenes driving diverse cancers are c-MYC, EGFR, HER2, AKT, KRAS, BRAF, and MEK. Using a reductionist approach, we explored how cellular proteomes are remodeled in isogenic cell lines engineered with or without these driver oncogenes. The most striking discovery for all oncogenic models was the systematic downregulation of scores of antiviral proteins regulated by type 1 interferon. These findings extended to cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models of highly refractory pancreatic cancer and osteosarcoma driven by KRAS and MYC oncogenes. The oncogenes reduced basal expression of and autocrine stimulation by type 1 interferon causing remarkable convergence on common phenotypic and functional profiles. In particular, there was dramatically lower expression of dsRNA sensors including DDX58 (RIG-I) and OAS proteins, which resulted in attenuated functional responses when the oncogenic cells were treated with the dsRNA mimetic, polyI:C, and increased susceptibility to infection with an RNA virus shown using SARS-CoV-2.

GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer.",35637349.0,10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01033-3,,5/30/2022,22-Jul,7/1/2022,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.2 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.3 Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.4 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.5 Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.9 Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.10 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.11 Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.12 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.13 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.14 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.15 Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA. olzmann@berkeley.edu.",,,2022 Jul;18(7):751-761.,0.0,biorxiv 10.1101/2022.04.11.487892,1

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physicochemical data and 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize the sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 30% of those currently known, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. 16S rRNA gene amplicon screening of 224 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs retrieved from a single site are representative of the microbial community in the vent field sediments. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison between Auka MAGs and MAGs from Guaymas Basin revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap, suggestive of long-distance species transfer over 400 km and subsequent sediment colonization. Optimal growth temperature prediction on the Auka MAGs, and thousands of reference genomes, shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently.

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection.

We aimed to determine whether physical activity independently associates with expression of inflammatory genes among people with RA.              Methods:                    This was a prospective observational study of adults with RA. Physical activity was measured by quantitative actigraphy over 7 consecutive days, and peripheral blood collected during the same time period was used for RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression, pathway, and network analyses.              Results:                    Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56±12 years, 91% female, 31% white, 9% African American, 9% Asian, 40% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj<0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.

Pollard",biorxiv,Pitfalls of genotyping microbial communities with rapidly growing genome collections,"SUMMARYDetecting genetic variants in metagenomic data is a priority for understanding the evolution, ecology, and functional characteristics of microbial communities. Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments. Both cause metagenotype errors.This dilemma can be mitigated by leveraging paired-end reads, customizing databases to species detected in the sample, and adjusting post-alignment filters.",,10.1101/2022.06.30.498336,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498336v1,2022.06.30.498336,7/2/2022,,7/2/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology","Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California",,,0.0,,

We hypothesized that phyllosphere interactions may be disrupted in a greenhouse setting, where microbial dispersal is limited, and that adding a microbial amendment might yield important benefits to the host plant.Using a newly developed synthetic phyllosphere microbiome for Tomato, we tested this hypothesis across multiple trials by manipulating microbial colonization of leaves and measuring subsequent plant growth and reproductive success, comparing results from plants grown in both greenhouse and field settings.We confirmed that greenhouse-grown plants have a depauperate phyllosphere microbiome and that the addition of the synthetic microbial community was responsible for a clear and repeatable increase in fruit production in this setting. We further show that this effect is synergistic with the addition of micronutrient-based soil amendments, with important implications for agriculture.These results suggest that greenhouse environments have poor phyllosphere microbiome establishment, with negative impacts on the plant. The results also implicate the phyllosphere microbiome as a key component of plant fitness, emphasizing that these communities have a clear role to play in the ecology and evolution of plant communities.",,10.1101/2022.06.30.498294,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498294v1,2022.06.30.498294,7/2/2022,,7/2/2022,"Agricultural Research Service, Western Regional Research Center, Crop Improvement and Genetics Research Unit; Azomite Mineral Products, Inc.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Environmental Studies, Haverford College; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science; The Chopra Foundation; i-Cultiver, Inc.","Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Agricultural Research Service, Western Regional Research Center, Crop Improvement and Genetics Research Unit; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Environmental Studies, Haverford College; Azomite Mineral Products, Inc.; i-Cultiver, Inc.; i-Cultiver, Inc.; Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science; The Chopra Foundation; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Garcia",biorxiv,Competing constraints shape the non-equilibrium limits of cellular decision making,"Gene regulation is central to cellular function. Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,10.1101/2022.07.01.498451,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498451v1,2022.07.01.498451,7/3/2022,,7/3/2022,"Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology","Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) – two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphic workflowThe Figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license.",,10.1101/2022.07.04.498721,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498721v1,2022.07.04.498721,7/4/2022,,7/4/2022,"Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna","Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",,,0.0,,

Recent genomic analyses have profoundly reshaped our understanding of the distribution and functionalities of Archaea and their roles in eukaryotic evolution.              Results:                    Here, 1179 representative genomes were selected from 3197 archaeal genomes. The representative genomes clustered based on the content of 10,866 newly defined archaeal protein families (that will serve as a community resource) recapitulates archaeal phylogeny. We identified the co-occurring proteins that distinguish the major lineages. Those with metabolic roles were consistent with experimental data. However, two families specific to Asgard were determined to be new eukaryotic signature proteins. Overall, the blocks of lineage-specific families are dominated by proteins that lack functional predictions.              Conclusions:                    Given that these hypothetical proteins are near ubiquitous within major archaeal groups, we propose that they were important in the origin of most of the major archaeal lineages. Interestingly, although there were clearly phylum-specific co-occurring proteins, no such blocks of protein families were shared across superphyla, suggesting a burst-like origin of new lineages early in archaeal evolution.

We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models.

High doses of intravenously-delivered vector are required to reach the CNS, which has resulted in varying adverse effects. Moreover, selective transduction of various cell types might be important depending on the disorder being treated. To enhance BBB penetration and improve CNS cell selectivity, we screened an AAV capsid-shuffled library using an in vitro transwell BBB system with separate layers of human endothelial cells, primary astrocytes and/or hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. After multiple passages through the transwell, we identified chimeric AAV capsids with enhanced penetration and improved transduction of astrocytes and/or neurons compared to wild-type capsids. We identified the amino acid (aa) from region 451-470 of AAV2 associated with the capsids selected for neurons, and a combination of aa from regions 413-496 of AAV-rh10 and 538-598 of AAV3B/LK03 associated with capsids selected for astrocytes.

ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1.

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population. Comorbid lung disease and lower levels of initial IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen were associated with longer symptom duration.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04373148.FUNDINGNIH UL1TR003142 CTSA grant, NIH U54CA260517 grant, NIEHS R21 ES03304901, Sean N Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sunshine Foundation, Crown Foundation, and Parker Foundation.

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity. In summary, we provide an atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of epigenetic state can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a recently established method for culture-independent LRTI diagnosis, but its utility for predicting AMR has remained unclear. We aimed to assess the performance of mNGS for AMR prediction in bacterial LRTI and demonstrate proof of concept for epidemiological AMR surveillance and rapid AMR gene detection using Cas9 enrichment and nanopore sequencing.              Methods:                    We studied 88 patients with acute respiratory failure between 07/2013 and 9/2018, enrolled through a previous observational study of LRTI. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory specimen collection within 72 h of intubation. Exclusion criteria were decline of study participation, unclear LRTI status, or no matched RNA and DNA mNGS data from a respiratory specimen. Patients with LRTI were identified by clinical adjudication. mNGS was performed on lower respiratory tract specimens. The primary outcome was mNGS performance for predicting phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and was assessed in patients with LRTI from culture-confirmed bacterial pathogens with clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing (n = 27 patients, n = 32 pathogens). Secondary outcomes included the association between hospital exposure and AMR gene burden in the respiratory microbiome (n = 88 patients), and AMR gene detection using Cas9 targeted enrichment and nanopore sequencing (n = 10 patients).              Results:                    Compared to clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the performance of respiratory mNGS for predicting AMR varied by pathogen, antimicrobial, and nucleic acid type sequenced. For gram-positive bacteria, a combination of RNA + DNA mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47-87%) and specificity of 95% (CI 85-99%). For gram-negative bacteria, sensitivity was 100% (CI 87-100%) and specificity 64% (CI 48-78%). Patients with hospital-onset LRTI had a greater AMR gene burden in their respiratory microbiome versus those with community-onset LRTI (p = 0.00030), or those without LRTI (p = 0.0024). We found that Cas9 targeted sequencing could enrich for low abundance AMR genes by > 2500-fold and enabled their rapid detection using a nanopore platform.              Conclusions:                    mNGS has utility for the detection and surveillance of resistant bacterial LRTI pathogens.",35818068.0,10.1186/s13073-022-01072-4.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9275031/,,,7/12/2022,7/12/2022,"1 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.5 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.6 Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, San Francisco, CA, USA.7 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.8 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.9 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. chaz.langelier@ucsf.edu.",,,2022 Jul 12;14(1):74.,0.0,,

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.

Boothroyd",biorxiv,Coupling cryo-electron tomography with mixed-scale dense neural networks reveals re-organization of the invasion machinery of Toxoplasma gondii upon ionophore-stimulation,"Host cell invasion by intracellular, eukaryotic parasites within the phylum Apicomplexa, is a remarkable and active process involving the coordinated action of apical organelles and other structures. To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.Significance Statement Parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data. Combined, the results provide new information on how these important parasites accomplish the essential step of invasion.",,10.1101/2022.01.12.476068,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.476068v2,2022.01.12.476068,7/13/2022,,7/13/2022,"Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Application (CAMERA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Mathematics, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh; Division of Cryo-EM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh; Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics - Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Mathematics, University of California; Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Application (CAMERA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Division of Cryo-EM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0.0,,

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.

We conducted a population size-weighted, one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of health insurance coverage, using a population-based sample of 2,035,401 participants ages 15-59 from nationally representative household surveys in fifty-six countries during the period 2006-18. One in five people (20.3 percent) across the fifty-six countries in our study had health insurance. Health insurance coverage exceeded 50 percent in only seven countries and 70 percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4 percent versus 28.6 percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege.

Smolke",biorxiv,Highly multiplexed selection of RNA aptamers against a small molecule library,"Applications of synthetic biology spanning human health, industrial bioproduction, and ecosystem monitoring often require small molecule sensing capabilities, typically in the form of genetically encoded small molecule biosensors. Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.16.500284v1,2022.07.16.500284,7/16/2022,,7/16/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3’s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3′-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.499945v1,2022.07.15.499945,7/16/2022,,7/16/2022,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",,,0.0,,

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases.

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.

While the cyclical processes of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration characterizing their life cycle have been documented previously, the cellular and molecular changes associated with such processes and their relationship with variation in brain morphology and individual (zooid) behavior throughout adult life remains unknown. Here, we introduce Botryllus schlosseri as an invertebrate model for neurogenesis, neural degeneration, and evolutionary neuroscience. Our analysis reveals that during the weekly colony budding (i.e., asexual reproduction), prior to programmed cell death and removal by phagocytes, decreases in the number of neurons in the adult brain are associated with reduced behavioral response and significant change in the expression of 73 mammalian homologous genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Similarly, when comparing young colonies (1 to 2 y of age) to those reared in a laboratory for ∼20 y, we found that older colonies contained significantly fewer neurons and exhibited reduced behavioral response alongside changes in the expression of 148 such genes (35 of which were differentially expressed across both timescales). The existence of two distinct yet apparently related neurodegenerative pathways represents a novel platform to study the gene products governing the relationship between aging, neural regeneration and degeneration, and loss of nervous system function. Indeed, as a member of an evolutionary clade considered to be a sister group of vertebrates, this organism may be a fundamental resource in understanding how evolution has shaped these processes across phylogeny and obtaining mechanistic insight.

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale. In contrast, we detected evidence for RuBisCO throughout the water column and sediments, including form II/III and form III-related enzymes encoded by CPR bacteria in the water column and DPANN archaea in the sediments.

Manual sample preparation remains a slow, expensive, and error-prone process. Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts – RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (−11x), cost (−3x), and biohazardous waste produced (−4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total).

Using the antibody sequence to trace cell lineage during in vitro differentiation, we identified intrinsic proliferative and cell fate biases of B cell subtypes. Clonal analysis revealed that IgM memory B cells were more proliferative than any other B cell subtype, and that cells from the same clone had highly concordant fates. We found that transcriptional memory within clones varies across genes, with strongest persistence in genes related to cell fate determination. Similar persistent transcriptional programs were observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, suggesting that these programs maintain long-term cell fate in vivo.

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors.

While we can alter an organoid's morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid's morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids.

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex (Δrnf) or just the MmcA subunit (ΔmmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the ΔmmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the Δrnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.Importance Methane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500911,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500911v1,2022.07.20.500911,7/21/2022,,7/21/2022,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California",,,0.0,,

We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues.

Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors. These findings suggest that engagement in sport may benefit the brain across numerous domains, but also highlights the potentially damaging effects of concussive head injury.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.22277627,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/22/2022.07.21.22277627.1,2022.07.21.22277627,7/22/2022,,7/22/2022,"Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF)","The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London; Neurotrauma and Ophthalmology Research Group, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, University of Birmingham; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; Marker Diagnostics UK Limited, the BioHub, Birmingham research park, Birmingham UK College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham; Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine; The International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF); The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London",,,0.0,,

Targeting ∼7000 genes with this methodology, we discovered SAGA complex members Tada2b and Taf5l as key regulators of HSC lineage commitment. Loss of Tada2b or Taf5l inhibited hematopoiesis in vivo and was associated with upregulation of interferon response gene expression. SAGA complex member expression is significantly reduced in aged HSCs and upregulated with heterochronic parabiosis, suggesting a novel mechanism of age-associated hematopoietic decline and rejuvenation.

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue com-position within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression.

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet-to-be-defined host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.

Using bioinformatics and chemoproteomics, we identify serine hydrolases in the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that are specific to the Bacteroidetes phylum. Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling. Functional studies reveal that BT4193 is a true homolog of hDPP4 while the other is misannotated and is a proline-specific triaminopeptidase. We demonstrate that BT4193 is important for envelope integrity and is inhibited by FDA-approved type 2 diabetes drugs that target hDPP4. Loss of BT4193 reduces B. thetaiotaomicron fitness during in vitro growth within a diverse community.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Disruption of both mTOR complexes leads to pronounced deficits in dopamine release demonstrating the importance of balanced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling for dopaminergic function.

In Escherichia coli, the Rcs system is required to survive A22 and mecillinam treatment, two drugs that perturb cell size. To test whether cell size changes might be correlated with envelope damage and thereby sensed by the Rcs system, we tuned E. coli cell size via drug inhibition with A22, point mutations to the cell-shape determinant MreB, and mechanically confined growth. In all conditions, cell width was strongly correlated with Rcs activation, with wider cells exhibiting more activation than wild-type. In all conditions, RcsF, the outer membrane-localized upstream component of the Rcs system, was essential for responding to cell width changes. Consistently, several envelope gene deletions known to induce the Rcs system via RcsF resulted in cells that were wider than wild-type. Cryo- electron microscopy revealed that the periplasm of a wide MreB mutant was on average ∼3 nm thinner than wild-type, thereby bringing RcsF closer to the downstream components of the signaling cascade in the inner membrane. Conversely, extending the flexible linker region of RcsF by ∼3 nm increased Rcs activity in wild-type cells.

In response, cells mount complex responses across multiple scales, including adjusting their shape to withstand stress. In enterobacteria, the Rcs phosphorelay is activated by cell envelope damage and by changes to periplasmic dimensions and cell width. Here, we investigated the physiological and morphological consequences of Rcs activation in Escherichia coli in the absence of stresses, using an inducible version of RcsF that mislocalizes to the inner membrane, RcsFIM. Expression of RcsFIM immediately reduced cellular growth rate and the added length per cell cycle in a manner that was directly dependent on induction levels, but independent of Rcs-induced capsule production. At the same time, cells increased intracellular concentration of the cell division protein FtsZ, and decreased the distance between division rings in filamentous cells. Depletion of the Rcs negative regulator IgaA phenocopied RcsFIM induction, indicating that IgaA is essential due to growth inhibition in its absence. However, A22 treatment did not affect growth rate or FtsZ intracellular concentration, despite activating the Rcs system. These findings suggest that the effect of Rcs activation on FtsZ levels is mediated indirectly through growth-rate changes, and highlight feedbacks among the Rcs stress response, growth dynamics, and cell-size control.",,10.1101/2022.07.26.501648,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501648v1,2022.07.26.501648,7/27/2022,,7/27/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg","Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation.

Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion.

However, applying it to GPCRs without signaling proteins remains challenging because most receptors lack structural features in their soluble domains to facilitate image alignment. In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring different fusion protein designs, which lead to structures of antagonist bound A2A adenosine receptor at 3.4 Å resolution and unliganded Smoothened at 3.7 Å resolution.

Recently, several papers have called into question the performance of lattice light sheets relative to the Gaussian sheets most common in light sheet microscopy. Here we undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of various forms of light sheet microscopy which both demonstrates and explains why lattice light sheets provide significant improvements in resolution and photobleaching reduction. The analysis provides a procedure to select the correct light sheet for a desired experiment and specifies the processing that maximizes the use of all fluorescence generated within the light sheet excitation envelope for optimal resolution while minimizing image artifacts and photodamage. Development of a new type of “harmonic balanced” lattice light sheet is shown to improve performance at all spatial frequencies within its 3D resolution limits and maintains this performance over lengthened propagation distances allowing for expanded fields of view.Significance Statement Despite its rapidly growing use, several misconceptions remain concerning the physics of image formation and its optimization in light sheet microscopy, particularly in high resolution variants tailored for subcellular imaging. These include the role of excitation sidelobes, the significance of out-of-focus fluorescence, the importance and optimization of deconvolution, and the perceived advantages of Gaussian beams. Here we attempt to shatter these misconceptions by showing that the professed tradeoffs between axial resolution and background haze, photobleaching rate, phototoxicity, and propensity for image artifacts do not exist for well-crafted lattice light sheets whose data is acquired and processed rigorously. The framework we provide should enable others to optimize light sheets and extract the most information at the lowest cost in their experiments.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502108,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502108v1,2022.07.30.502108,7/30/2022,,7/30/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Physics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Department of Physics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0.0,,

Our system is sensitive to structural and cellular changes at micron-scale resolution in vivo, such as those from injury or disease. Therefore, it can serve as a tool to visualize and quantify spatiotemporal brain elasticity patterns. This highly transformative and versatile platform allows accurate investigation of brain cellular architectural changes by quantifying features such as brain cell bodies' density, volume, and average distance to the nearest cell.

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation. Our findings reveal β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells implying a role of S1P1 signaling in remyelination.

Here we describe an adult stem cell-derived human airway organoid model overexpressing the ACE2 receptor that supports robust viral replication while maintaining 3D architecture and cellular diversity of the airway epithelium. ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the exception of bebtelovimab.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene in Culex mosquitoes are associated with knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. RNAseq was used to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. The cDNA sequences were used to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F kdr mutation in the Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay was used successfully in six Culex spp. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. The L1014F kdr mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and was more prevalent in mosquitoes collected near farmland. The Culex RTkdr assay takes advantage of the RNA that vector control agencies routinely isolate to assess arbovirus prevalence in mosquitoes. We anticipate that public health and vector control agencies may employ the Culex RTkdr assay to define the geographic distribution of the L1014F kdr mutation in Culex species and improve the monitoring of insecticide resistance that will ultimately contribute to effective control of Culex mosquitoes.",35939507,10.1371/journal.pone.0252498.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9359573/,,2022,08/08/2022,08/08/2022,"1 Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District, Hayward, CA, United States of America.2 School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States of America.3 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.4 University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.5 Sacramento-Yolo County Mosquito and Vector Control District, Elk Grove, CA, United States of America.",,,2022 Aug 8;17(8):e0252498.,1.0,,

Defects in alternative splicing are associated with many heart diseases, yet relatively little is known about how cell type- or cell state-specific alternative splicing is achieved in the heart. Here, we show that GATA4 regulates cell type-specific splicing through direct interaction with RNA and the spliceosome in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors.              Methods:                    We leveraged a combination of unbiased approaches including affinity purification of GATA4 and mass spectrometry, enhanced cross-linking with immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, in vitro splicing assays, and unbiased transcriptomic analysis to uncover GATA4's novel function as a splicing regulator in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors.              Results:                    We found that GATA4 interacts with many members of the spliceosome complex in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors. Enhanced cross-linking with immunoprecipitation demonstrated that GATA4 also directly binds to a large number of mRNAs through defined RNA motifs in a sequence-specific manner. In vitro splicing assays indicated that GATA4 regulates alternative splicing through direct RNA binding, resulting in functionally distinct protein products. Correspondingly, knockdown of GATA4 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors resulted in differential alternative splicing of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization and calcium ion import, with functional consequences associated with the protein isoforms.              Conclusions:                    This study shows that in addition to its well described transcriptional function, GATA4 interacts with members of the spliceosome complex and regulates cell type-specific alternative splicing via sequence-specific interactions with RNA. Several genes that have splicing regulated by GATA4 have functional consequences and many are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting a novel role for GATA4 in achieving the necessary cardiac proteome in normal and stress-responsive conditions.

Thyroid hormone synthesis is controlled by thyrotropin (TSH), which acts at the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR)2. Autoantibodies that activate the TSHR pathologically increase thyroid hormones in Graves' disease3. How autoantibodies mimic TSH function remains unclear. We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of active and inactive TSHR. In inactive TSHR, the extracellular domain lies close to the membrane bilayer. TSH selects an upright orientation of the extracellular domain due to steric clashes between a conserved hormone glycan and the membrane bilayer. An activating autoantibody from a Graves' disease patient selects a similar upright orientation of the extracellular domain. Reorientation of the extracellular domain transduces a conformational change in the seven transmembrane domain via a conserved hinge domain, a tethered peptide agonist, and a phospholipid that binds within the seven transmembrane domain. Rotation of the TSHR extracellular domain relative to the membrane bilayer is sufficient for receptor activation, revealing a shared mechanism for other glycoprotein hormone receptors that may also extend to other G protein-coupled receptors with large extracellular domains.",35940205,10.1038/s41586-022-05159-1.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05159-1,,,08/08/2022,08/08/2022,"1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.2 Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.3 Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.4 Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.5 Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.6 Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.7 Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.8 Mass Spectrometry Core for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.9 Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.10 Trophogen, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.11 Clayton Foundation Laboratory for Peptide Biology Lab, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.12 Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Current treatment strategies focus on mTOR inhibition with rapamycin and its derivatives. While effective at improving some aspects of TSC, chronic rapamycin inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and is associated with systemic side-effects. It is currently unknown which mTOR complex is most relevant for TSC-related brain phenotypes. Here we used genetic strategies to selectively reduce neuronal mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity in mouse models of TSC. We find that reduction of the mTORC1 component Raptor, but not the mTORC2 component Rictor, rebalanced mTOR signaling in Tsc1 knock-out neurons. Raptor reduction was sufficient to improve several TSC-related phenotypes including neuronal hypertrophy, macrocephaly, impaired myelination, network hyperactivity, and premature mortality.

It is unknown how dietary changes influence liver homeostasis. Here, we show that a switch from ad libitum feeding to intermittent fasting, IF, promotes rapid hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat.

Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs.

Consequently, CB1 is an important therapeutic target for several neurological disorders. How eCBs interact with CB1 is not known and the downstream signaling they activate is not well understood. In this study we show that eCBs do not activate Gi1 as much as synthetic cannabinoids. To characterize activation of CB1 by eCB, we formed an eCB analogue-bound (AMG315) CB1-Gi signaling complex for structural studies. The structure reveals differences in the orthosteric ligand binding pocket not seen in the previous CB1 structures, providing insights into the structural determinants of ligand efficacy.

Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell type evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell profiles to those of the homologous cells in human and mouse. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate cell specialization even within a single tissue compartment, as well as many cell types for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse.

Lishko",biorxiv,Mitochondrial uncouplers impair human sperm motility without altering ATP content,"Sperm motility is necessary for successful fertilization, but there remains controversy about whether human sperm motility is primarily powered by glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.Significance Statement Development of novel contraceptives is critical, since half of all pregnancies are still unplanned, even in developed countries. This high unplanned pregnancy rate contributes to a wide variety of social, environmental, and ecological problems. Impairing human sperm is a way to develop male and unisex contraceptives, but much remains unknown about these unique cells. Here we settle a long-running debate about human sperm metabolism, finding that human sperm can maintain their ATP levels without mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This finding will help focus future contraceptive development efforts. We also identify the potential use of an FDA-approved compound (Niclosamide) as a motility-impairing ingredient in spermicides and correct the misunderstood subcellular localization of an existing contraceptive target, Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502752,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502752v2,2022.08.04.502752,08/08/2022,,08/08/2022,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Urology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University","Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Urology, University of California; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging",,,1.0,,

Secreted factors regulate organ development and mediate homeostasis through serum trafficking and inter-organ communication. Enzyme-catalysed proximity labelling enables the identification of proteins within a specific cellular compartment. Here, we report a BirA*G3 mouse strain that enables CRE-dependent promiscuous biotinylation of proteins trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum. When broadly activated throughout the mouse, widespread labelling of proteins was observed within the secretory pathway. Streptavidin affinity purification and peptide mapping by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics revealed organ-specific secretory profiles and serum trafficking. As expected, secretory proteomes were highly enriched for signal peptide-containing proteins, highlighting both conventional and non-conventional secretory processes, and ectodomain shedding. Lower-abundance proteins with hormone-like properties were recovered and validated using orthogonal approaches. Hepatocyte-specific activation of BirA*G3 highlighted liver-specific biotinylated secretome profiles. The BirA*G3 mouse model demonstrates enhanced labelling efficiency and tissue specificity over viral transduction approaches and will facilitate a deeper understanding of secretory protein interplay in development, and in healthy and diseased adult states.

Air pollution in many areas of South Asia is seasonal, with large spikes in particulate matter (PM) concentration occurring in the winter months. This study exploits this seasonal variation in PM concentration through a natural experiment.              Objective:                    This project aims to determine the causal effect of PM exposure during pregnancy on pregnancy and child health outcomes.              Methods:                    We will use an instrumental variable (IV) design whereby the estimated month of conception is our instrument for exposure to PM with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) during pregnancy. We will assess the plausibility of our assumption that timing of conception is exogenous with regard to our outcomes of interest and will adjust for date of monsoon onset to control for confounding variables related to harvest timing. Our outcomes are 1) birth weight, 2) pregnancy termination resulting in miscarriage, abortion, or still birth, 3) neonatal death, 4) infant death, and 5) child death. We will use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in relevant regions of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, along with monthly gridded data on PM2.5 concentration (0.1°×0.1° spatial resolution), precipitation data (0.5°×0.5° resolution), temperature data (0.5°×0.5°), and agricultural land use data (0.1°×0.1° resolution).              Results:                    Data access to relevant DHSs was granted on June 6, 2021 for India, Nepal, Bangladesh, August 24, 2021 for Pakistan, and June 19 2022 for the latest DHS from India.              Conclusions:                    If the assumptions for a causal interpretation of our instrumental variable analysis are met, this analysis will provide important causal evidence on the maternal and child health effects of PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy. This evidence is important to inform personal behavior and interventions, such as the adoption of indoor air filtration during pregnancy as well as environmental and health policy.

A lack of suitable model systems limits the mechanistic understanding of telomere shortening in the stem cells and thus hinders the development of treatment options for BM failure. Here, we endogenously introduced TIN2-DC mutations in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to dissect the disease mechanism and identify a gene-editing strategy that rescued the disease phenotypes. The hESCs with the T284R disease mutation exhibited the short telomere phenotype observed in DC patients. Yet, telomeres in mutant hESCs did not trigger DNA damage responses at telomeres or show exacerbated telomere shortening when differentiated into telomerase-negative cells. Disruption of the mutant TINF2 allele by introducing a frameshift mutation in exon 2 restored telomere length in stem cells and the replicative potential of differentiated cells. Similarly, we introduced TIN2-DC disease variants in human HSPCs to assess the changes in telomere length and proliferative capacity. Lastly, we showed that editing at exon 2 of TINF2 that restored telomere length in hESCs could be generated in TINF2-DC patient HSPCs. Our study demonstrates a simple genetic intervention that rescues the TIN2-DC disease phenotype in stem cells and provides a versatile platform to assess the efficacy of potential therapeutic approaches in vivo.",35421215,10.1182/blood.2021013750.,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2021013750,,,08/11/2022,08/11/2022,"1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.2 Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.3 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.4 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA; and.5 Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.",,,2022 Aug 11;140(6):608-618.,1.0,,

However, purification of these nanoparticles is often laborious and requires customization for each potential nanoparticle vaccine. We propose that the simple insertion of a polyhistidine tag into exposed flexible loops on the ferritin surface (His-Fer) can mitigate the need for complex purifications and enable facile metal-chelate-based purification, thereby allowing for optimization of early stage vaccine candidates. Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type. Finally, we show that purified His-Fer proteins remain multimeric and elicit robust immune responses similar to those of their wild-type counterparts.

Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",35969644,10.1371/journal.ppat.1010543.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9410543/,,08/2022,08/15/2022,08/15/2022,"1 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.2 Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.3 Diamond Light Source, Didcot, United Kingdom.4 Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.5 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.6 Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.7 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.8 Chan-Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, California, United States of America.9 Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.10 Department of Cell Biology & Physiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.11 Department of Microbiology & Immunology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.",,,2022 Aug 15;18(8):e1010543.,1.0,biorxiv 10.1101/2022.04.26.489493,5

However, the estimated velocity only gives a snapshot of how the transcriptome instantaneously changes in individual cells, and it does not provide quantitative predictions and insights about the whole system. In this work, we develop RNA-ODE, a principled computational framework that extends RNA velocity to quantify systems level dynamics and improve single-cell data analysis. We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism. Given a snapshot of gene expression at one time, RNA-ODE is able to predict and extrapolate the expression trajectory of each cell by solving the dynamic equations. Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also infers gene regulatory networks and identifies influential genes whose expression changes can decide cell fate. We expect RNA-ODE to be a Swiss army knife that aids many facets of single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.

This task is particularly challenging for numerous biomedically important targets in human cells, including membrane proteins and large macromolecular assemblies, hampering mechanistic studies and drug development efforts. Here we describe a method combining CRISPR-Cas gene editing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to rapidly tag and purify endogenous proteins in HEK cells for structural characterization. We applied this approach to study the human proteasome from HEK cells and rapidly determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of major proteasomal complexes, including a high-resolution structure of intact human PA28αβ-20S. Our structures reveal that PA28 with a subunit stoichiometry of 3α/4β engages tightly with the 20S proteasome. Addition of a hydrophilic peptide shows that polypeptides entering through PA28 are held in the antechamber of 20S prior to degradation in the proteolytic chamber. This study provides critical insights into an important proteasome complex and demonstrates key methodologies for the tagging of proteins from endogenous sources.

THP is a precursor in the production of the drugs atracurium and cisatracurium, and papaverine is used as an antispasmodic during vascular surgery. In recent years, metabolic engineering advances have enabled the production of natural products through heterologous expression of pathway enzymes in yeast. Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products. Biosynthesis of THP and papaverine has not been achieved to date, in part because multiple pathway enzymes have not been elucidated. Here, we describe the development of an engineered yeast strain for de novo biosynthesis of THP. The production of THP is achieved through heterologous expression of two enzyme variants with activity on nonnative substrates. Through protein engineering, we developed a variant of N-methylcoclaurine hydroxylase with activity on coclaurine, enabling de novo norreticuline biosynthesis. Similarly, we developed a variant of scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase capable of O-methylating 1-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids at the 3' position, enabling de novo THP biosynthesis. Flux through the heterologous pathway was improved by knocking out yeast multidrug resistance transporters and optimization of media conditions. Overall, strain engineering increased the concentration of biosynthesized THP 600-fold to 121 µg/L. Finally, we demonstrate a strategy for papaverine semisynthesis using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. Through optimizing pH, temperature, reaction time, and oxidizing agent concentration, we demonstrated the ability to produce semisynthesized papaverine through oxidation of biosynthesized THP.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones.

We present a compact, tunable, high-capacity Cas12a barcoding system called dual acting inverted site array (DAISY). We combined high-throughput screening and machine learning to predict and optimize the 60-bp DAISY barcode sequences. After optimization, top-performing barcodes had ∼10-fold increased capacity relative to the best random-screened designs and performed reliably across diverse cell types. DAISY barcode arrays generated ∼12 bits of entropy and ∼66,000 unique barcodes. Thus, DAISY barcodes-at a fraction of the size of Cas9 barcodes-achieved high-capacity barcoding. We coupled DAISY barcoding with single-cell RNA-seq to recover lineages and gene expression profiles from ∼47,000 human melanoma cells. A single DAISY barcode recovered up to ∼700 lineages from one parental cell.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue composition within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude. These results suggest that our EIS smart bone plate can provide continuous and highly sensitive quantitative tissue measurements throughout the course of fracture healing to better guide personalized clinical care.

Attempts have been made in the past to computationally predict which bacterial species and enzymes are responsible for chemical transformations in the gut environment, but with low accuracy due to minimal chemical representation and sequence similarity search schemes. Here, we present an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER). We show that SIMMER predicts the chemistry and responsible species and enzymes for a queried reaction with high accuracy, unlike previous methods. We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug transformations known to occur in the human gut. Bacterial species containing these enzymes are enriched within human donor stool samples that metabolize the query compound. After demonstrating its utility and accuracy, we chose to make SIMMER available as both a command-line and web tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical transformations within the human gut. We present SIMMER as a computational addition to the microbiome researcher’s toolbox, enabling them to make informed hypotheses before embarking on the lengthy laboratory experiments required to characterize novel bacterial enzymes that can alter human ingested compounds.",,10.1101/2022.08.02.502504,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.02.502504v2,2022.08.02.502504,08/11/2022,,08/11/2022,"Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco; Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics Graduate Program, University of California","Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics Graduate Program, University of California; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology, Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California",,,1.0,,

Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary → peripheral endocrine gland → diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies. The network nature of hormone regulation and the principles discovered here further emphasize the importance of a systems approach to understanding hormone regulation.",,10.1101/2021.12.13.472243,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.13.472243v2,2021.12.13.472243,08/14/2022,,08/14/2022,"Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine; Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University; Paul G.

To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, while others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each individual mutant in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, while others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with the same resistance gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with different resistance genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution, and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others. We add to a growing body of work describing the key role of phages in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host communities. Beyond this specific trait, our study provides new insight into the genetic architecture of historical contingency, a crucial component of interpreting and predicting evolution.

We show in a series of examples that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches for inferring RNA velocity with improvements in fit to the data, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells, and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that properties unique to veloVI, such as posterior velocity uncertainty, can be used to assess the appropriateness of analysis with velocity to the data at hand.

Objectives:                    This cross-sectional study aimed to determine how hypertension prevalence in LMICs varies by individuals' education and household wealth, and how these socioeconomic gradients in hypertension prevalence are associated with a country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.              Methods:                    We pooled nationally representative household survey data from 76 LMICs. We disaggregated hypertension prevalence by education and household wealth quintile, and used regression analyses to adjust for age and sex.              Results:                    We included 1,211,386 participants in the analysis. Pooling across all countries, hypertension prevalence tended to be similar between education groups and household wealth quintiles. The only world region with a clear positive association of hypertension with education or household wealth quintile was Southeast Asia. Countries with a lower GDP per capita had, on average, a more positive association of hypertension with education and household wealth quintile than countries with a higher GDP per capita, especially in rural areas and among men.              Conclusions:                    Differences in hypertension prevalence between socioeconomic groups were generally small, with even the least educated and least wealthy groups having a substantial hypertension prevalence. Our cross-sectional interaction analyses of GDP per capita with the socioeconomic gradients of hypertension suggest that hypertension may increasingly affect adults in the lowest socioeconomic groups as LMICs develop economically.

Despite this, we currently lack a predictive understanding of how leaf-associated bacterial communities are structured within and across hosts, including how leaf traits shape this variation and how community assembly processes may differ across distinct microbial habitats on a leaf. In this study, we characterize the composition of bacterial phyllosphere communities from the upper and lower leaf surfaces of 66 plants across 24 species grown at a common site using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing leaves that vary in pH and stomatal densities and analyzing the leaf surfaces separately, we were able to test the key factors shaping the phyllosphere across host plant species from diverse geographical origins. We found a surprisingly large shared/core microbiome across species, as well as a strong effect of plant species and native origin in shaping composition. Importantly, we found the lower leaf side, where pH values are generally lower and stomatal densities higher, to have lower taxonomic richness relative to the upper leaf side. While the upper leaf side community appears to be more strongly influenced by dispersal effects, the lower leaf appears to be more strongly influenced by plant host filtering effects, as supported by higher relative abundance of shared core taxa and higher signatures of endemism. This work highlights important differences in community assembly processes across the upper and lower leaf microbiomes and underscores the importance of considering differences among habitats within a host when explaining microbial community assembly and composition.",,10.1101/2022.08.16.504148,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504148v1,2022.08.16.504148,08/17/2022,,08/17/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Bioscience Engineering, University of Antwerp; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California","Department of Bioscience Engineering, University of Antwerp; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,1.0,,

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS.

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.Methods We collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.Results Among 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples. Among 1,321 RT-PCR positive samples, 938/1321 (71%) were detected by BinaxNOW; 95% (774/817) of those with Ct value <30 were detected by BinaxNOW. BinaxNOW detection was consistent over lineages. In analyses to evaluate entry to treatment, BinaxNOW detected 82.7% (410/496, 95% CI: 79-86%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In comparison, RT-PCR (24-hour turnaround) detected 83.1% (412/496 95% CI: 79-86%) and RT-PCR (48-hour turnaround) detected 66.3% (329/496 95% CI: 62-70%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset.Conclusions BinaxNOW detected high viral load from anterior nasal swabs consistently across omicron sublineages emerging between January and June of 2022.

While many studies have focused on tick-borne bacteria, far less is known about tick-associated viruses and their roles in public health or tick physiology. To address this, we investigated patterns of bacterial and viral communities across two field populations of western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 100 individual ticks, we quantified taxon prevalence, abundance, and co-occurrence with other members of the tick microbiome. Our analysis revealed 11 novel RNA viruses from Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Picornaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Reoviridae, Solemovidiae, Narnaviridae, and 2 highly divergent RNA viruses lacking sequence similarity to known viral families. The majority of these viruses were also detectable in lab-raised ticks at all developmental life stages, localize to tick salivary glands, and show evidence of circulation in mice fed on by ticks. These data suggest that viruses are stable, heritable, and transmissible members of the tick microbiota. We also unexpectedly identified numerous virus-like transcripts that are associated with tick genomic DNA, most of which are distinct from known endogenous viral element-mediated immunity pathways in invertebrates. Together, our work reveals that in addition to potentially serving as vectors for potential viral pathogens, I. pacificus ticks may also have symbiotic partnerships with their own vertically-transmitted viruses or with ancient viruses through evolutionarily acquired virus-like transcripts. Our findings highlight how pervasive and intimate tick–virus interactions are, with major implications for both the fundamental physiology and vector biology of I. pacificus ticks.",,10.1101/2022.08.17.504163,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.17.504163v1,2022.08.17.504163,08/18/2022,,08/18/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California – San Francisco; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University - Fort Collins; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California - San Francisco; Gladstone Institute of Data Science & Biotechnology; One Health Institute, Colorado State University - Fort Collins","Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California – San Francisco; Gladstone Institute of Data Science & Biotechnology; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California – San Francisco; One Health Institute, Colorado State University - Fort Collins; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California – San Francisco; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University - Fort Collins; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University - Fort Collins; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science & Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California - San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California – San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,1.0,,

In response to infection by its viral host ICP1, PLE excises, replicates and hijacks ICP1 structural components for transduction. Through an unknown mechanism, PLE prevents ICP1 from transitioning to rolling circle replication (RCR), a prerequisite for efficient packaging of the viral genome. Here, we characterize a PLE-encoded nuclease, NixI, that blocks phage development likely by nicking ICP1's genome as it transitions to RCR. NixI-dependent cleavage sites appear in ICP1's genome during infection of PLE(+) V. cholerae. Purified NixI demonstrates in vitro nuclease activity specifically for sites in ICP1's genome and we identify a motif that is necessary for NixI-mediated cleavage. Importantly, NixI is sufficient to limit ICP1 genome replication and eliminate progeny production, representing the most inhibitory PLE-encoded mechanism revealed to date. We identify distant NixI homologs in an expanded family of putative phage parasites in vibrios that lack nucleotide homology to PLEs but nonetheless share genomic synteny with PLEs. More generally, our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism deployed by phage parasites to limit packaging of their viral hosts' genome and highlight the prominent role of nuclease effectors as weapons in the arms race between antagonizing genomes.",35066583,10.1093/nar/gkac002.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9410903/,,,08/26/2022,08/26/2022,"1 Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, 271 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.2 Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.",,,2022 Aug 26;50(15):8401-8417.,1.0,,

Normally asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune dysfunction, and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth are not defined.

HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice.

We leverage a pandemic tracking strategy in which we sequence viral and host genomes and transcriptomes from nasopharyngeal swabs of 1049 individuals (736 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 313 SARS-CoV-2 negative) and integrate them with digital phenotypes from electronic health records from a diverse catchment area in Northern California. Genome-wide association disaggregated by admixture mapping reveals novel COVID-19-severity-associated regions containing previously reported markers of neurologic, pulmonary and viral disease susceptibility. Phylodynamic tracking of consensus viral genomes reveals no association with disease severity or inferred ancestry. Summary data from multiomic investigation reveals metagenomic and HLA associations with severe COVID-19.

The mass of our planet setting a constant gravitational pull and its daily rotation on its axis setting a circadian rhythm are two examples of universal ecological parameters that shape the physiology of every living creature on earth. In the ocean, gravity plays a critical role in shaping the life history of phytoplankton with vast diversity of size and cell geometries all depending on light to survive while gravity is pulling them down. In order to survive, these organisms must evolve means to navigate a vertically stratified ocean. Here we present how cellular topology can enable sinking, rising, and levitation dynamics of seemingly non-motile cells in the open ocean. By studying the bio-luminescent dinoflagellate Pyrocystis noctiluca, we discover how rapid inflation dynamics regulates cell size and buoyancy in coordination to its cell cycle. Live-cell light-sheet imaging reveals a (n-genus) toroidal cytoplasm that enables this rapid inflation of overall cell volume over 5 fold in 15 minutes without dilution of cytoplasmic contents. Here we present combined field and lab measurements with system modeling to build a general framework for how non-motile plankton can escape the gravitational sedimentation trap, and how precise control of cell size becomes essential to survival.

Design:                    Secondary analysis of nationally representative, cross-sectional, household survey data from 82 low and middle income countries collected between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020.              Setting:                    Population based survey data.              Participants:                    1 231 068 individuals aged 15 years and older.              Main outcome measures:                    Self-reported current smoking, current daily smoking, current smokeless tobacco use, current daily smokeless tobacco use, pack years, and current use and use frequencies of each tobacco product. Products were any type of cigarette, manufactured cigarette, hand rolled cigarette, water pipe, cigar, oral snuff, nasal snuff, chewing tobacco, and betel nut (with and without tobacco).              Results:                    The smoking prevalence in the study sample was 16.5% (95% confidence interval 16.1% to 16.9%) and ranged from 1.1% (0.9% to 1.3%) in Ghana to 50.6% (45.2% to 56.1%) in Kiribati. The user prevalence of smokeless tobacco was 7.7% (7.5% to 8.0%) and prevalence was highest in Papua New Guinea (daily user prevalence of 65.4% (63.3% to 67.5%)).

These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the nearly complete 16,740-nucleotide genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses-HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)-but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the virus's potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover. IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus that likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.

This architecture allows one pathway to be used in a variety of configurations, which could provide distinct functional capabilities, such as responding to different ligand variants. While individual pathways have been well-studied, we have lacked a comprehensive understanding of what receptor combinations are expressed and how they are distributed across cell types. Here, combining data from multiple single-cell gene expression atlases, we analyzed the expression profiles of core signaling pathways, including TGF-β, Notch, Wnt, and Eph-ephrin, as well as non-signaling pathways. In many pathways, a limited set of receptor expression profiles are used recurrently in many distinct cell types. While some recurrent profiles are restricted to groups of closely related cells, others, which we term pathway expression motifs, reappear in distantly related cell types spanning diverse tissues and organs. Motif usage was generally uncorrelated between pathways, remained stable in a given cell type during aging, but could change in sudden punctuated transitions during development. These results suggest a mosaic view of pathway usage, in which the same core pathways can be active in many or most cell types, but operate in one of a handful of distinct modes.",,10.1101/2022.08.21.504714,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.21.504714v1,2022.08.21.504714,08/22/2022,,08/22/2022,"Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology","Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology",,,1.0,,

To resolve causal variants, meta-analysis studies typically apply summary statistics-based fine-mapping methods as they are applied to single-cohort studies. However, it is unclear whether heterogeneous characteristics of each cohort (e.g., ancestry, sample size, phenotyping, genotyping, or imputation) affect fine-mapping calibration and recall. Here, we first demonstrate that meta-analysis fine-mapping is substantially miscalibrated in simulations when different genotyping arrays or imputation panels are included. To mitigate these issues, we propose a summary statistics-based QC method, SLALOM, that identifies suspicious loci for meta-analysis fine-mapping by detecting outliers in association statistics based on ancestry-matched local LD structure. Having validated SLALOM performance in simulations and the GWAS Catalog, we applied it to 14 disease endpoints from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative and found that 67% of loci showed suspicious patterns that call into question fine-mapping accuracy. These predicted suspicious loci were significantly depleted for having likely causal variants, such as nonsynonymous variants, as a lead variant (2.7x; Fisher’s exact P = 7.3 × 10−4). Compared to fine-mapping results in individual biobanks, we found limited evidence of fine-mapping improvement in the GBMI meta-analyses. Although a full solution requires complete synchronization across cohorts, our approach identifies likely spurious results in meta-analysis fine-mapping.

How animals without neurons process information and respond to environmental cues promises a new window into studying precursors of neuronal control and origin of the nervous system as we know it today. Robust decision making in animals, such as in chemotaxis or thermotaxis, often requires internal symmetry breaking (such as A-P axis) provided naturally by a given body plan of an animal. Here we report the discovery of robust thermotaxis behavior in Trichoplax adhaerens, an early-divergent, enigmatic animal with no anterior-posterior symmetry breaking (apolar), and no known neurons or muscles. We present the first quantitative and robust behavioral response assay in placozoan, which present an apolar flat geometry. By exposing T. adhaerens to a thermal gradient under a long-term imaging setup, we observe robust thermotaxis that occurs over timescale of hours, independent of any circadian rhythms. We quantify that T. adhaerens can detect thermal gradients of at least 0.1 °C/cm. Positive thermotaxis is observed for a range of baseline temperatures from 17-22.5 °C with motility trajectories to be well-described by a Lévy distribution. Interestingly, the organism does not maintain a fixed orientation while performing thermotaxis. Utilizing natural diversity in size of adult organisms (100um to a few mm), we also demonstrate a critical animal size above which thermotaxis behavior is hindered. Several TRP family homologs have been previously reported to be conserved in metazoans, including in T. adhaerens. We discover naringenin, a known TRPM3 antagonist, inhibits thermotaxis in T. adhaerens. The discovery of robust thermotaxis in T. adhaerens provides a tractable handle to interrogate information processing in a brainless animal.

We apply this model to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by fitting just one global parameter representing the frequency of interaction between individuals. We find that the predicted infections agree reasonably well with the reported cases. We clearly see the effect of “shelter-in-place” policies introduced at the onset of the pandemic. Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel. We find that this policy is successful in decreasing the epidemic size and slowing down the spread, but less effective than the shelter-in-place policy. This policy can result in a pulled wave of infections. We express its velocity and characterize the shape of the traveling front as a function of the epidemiological parameters.

To date, underlying molecular mechanisms of PSC remain unclear and therapeutic options for PSC patients are limited. We performed cell-free messenger RNA (cf-mRNA) next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the circulating transcriptome of PSC and non-invasively investigate potentially bioactive signals that are associated with PSC.METHODS Serum cf-mRNA profiles were compared among 50 individuals with PSC, 20 healthy controls, and 235 individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Tissue and cell type-of-origin genes that are dysregulated in subjects with PSC were evaluated. Subsequently, diagnostic classifiers were built using PSC dysregulated cf-mRNA genes.RESULTS Differential expression analysis of the cf-mRNA transcriptomes of PSC and healthy controls resulted in identification of 1407 dysregulated genes. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes between PSC and the liver diseases (NAFL and Non-Alcohol Steatohepatitis (NASH)) or healthy controls shared common genes known to be involved in liver pathophysiology. In particular, genes from liver- and specific cell type-origin, including hepatocyte, hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells, were highly abundant in cf-mRNA of subjects with PSC. Gene cluster analysis revealed that liver-specific genes dysregulated in PSC form a distinct cluster which corresponded to a subset of the PSC subject population. Finally, we developed a cf-mRNA classifier using liver-specific genes which discriminated PSC from healthy control subjects using gene transcripts of liver origin.CONCLUSIONS Blood-based whole transcriptome cf-mRNA profiling revealed high abundance of liver-specific genes in PSC subject sera which may be used to diagnose PSC patients.

It is thought to be a key contributing factor to childhood malnutrition, growth stunting, and diminished oral vaccine responses. Although EE has been shown to be the by-product of a recurrent enteric infection, its full pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, we mapped the cellular and molecular correlates of EE by performing high-throughput, single-cell RNA-sequencing on 33 small intestinal biopsies from 11 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia (eight HIV-negative and three HIV-positive), six adults without EE in Boston, United States, and two adults in Durban, South Africa, which we complemented with published data from three additional individuals from the same clinical site. We analyzed previously defined bulk-transcriptomic signatures of reduced villus height and decreased microbial translocation in EE and showed that these signatures may be driven by an increased abundance of surface mucosal cells-a gastric-like subset previously implicated in epithelial repair in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, we determined cell subsets whose fractional abundances associate with EE severity, small intestinal region, and HIV infection. Furthermore, by comparing duodenal EE samples with those from three control cohorts, we identified dysregulated WNT and MAPK signaling in the EE epithelium and increased proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in a T cell subset highly expressing a transcriptional signature of tissue-resident memory cells in the EE cohort.

Infection duration is influenced by host and parasite characteristics, and is highly important for gametocyte production but poorly quantified. Between 2017-2019 an all-age cohort from Tororo, eastern Uganda was followed by continuous passive and routine assessments. Among 104 longitudinally monitored incident infections coming from 98 individuals, we observed that nearly all infections lasting 3 or more months initiated gametocyte production prior to clearance. However, the majority of infections were of shorter duration (<28 days) and were cleared before gametocytes were detectable.

The glucagon receptor (GCGR), a Family B GPCR responsible for maintenance of proper blood sugar levels, interacts with RAMP2, though the purpose and consequence of this interaction is poorly understood. Using a series of biochemical and cell-based assays, we show that RAMP2 interacts with and broadly inhibits GCGR-induced downstream signaling. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) demonstrates that RAMP2 enhances local flexibility in select locations in and near the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) as well as at a key region in the 6th transmembrane helix, while single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments show that this RAMP2-induced ECD disorder results in inhibition of active and intermediate states of the intracellular face of the receptor. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), we determined the structure of the GCGR-Gs complex at 2.9 Å resolution in the presence of RAMP2. RAMP2 apparently does not interact with GCGR in an ordered manner, yet the ECD of GCGR is indeed largely disordered in the presence of RAMP2. This disorder is accompanied by rearrangements of several key areas of the receptor, resulting in the formation of a likely unproductive complex.

Yet the microbial functions that underpin this succession are not well described. Further, it’s unclear how previous precipitation frames microbial capacities after rewetting and how long these effects persist. We used isotopically-labeled water to rewet seasonally dry annual grassland soil that experienced either mean annual or reduced precipitation during the previous two years, and sampled at five subsequent time points. We used quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP)-informed genome- resolved metagenomics to identify growing microorganisms, predict their capabilities, and analyze how these traits differed over time and between precipitation treatments. Organisms that grew after wetup were more abundant than non-growing organisms prior to the wet-up, suggesting that traits that initiate succession are pre-defined at the end of the prior plant growing season or via survival over the summer. Fast-growing organisms had fewer carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) genes per genome than slower-growing organisms, suggesting that although fast-growers were capable of degrading complex C, they may not specialize in this process. Differential abundance of CAZy genes in growing organisms throughout the succession implies that substrate availability varied with time. In contrast, the abundance of peptidases in growing organisms differed between precipitation treatments, but not over time following wet-up. Before wet-up, the soil organisms’ gene inventories were different between the two precipitation treatments. Surprisingly, this legacy effect waned after just one week. Thus, pre-wetup differences in microbial functional capacity converged shortly after rewetting.",,10.1101/2022.06.28.498032,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.28.498032v2,2022.06.28.498032,08/31/2022,,08/31/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Life & Environmental Sciences Department, University of California Merced; Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; University of California Berkeley, Department of plant and microbial biology","University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; University of California Berkeley, Department of plant and microbial biology; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Life & Environmental Sciences Department, University of California Merced; Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,1.0,,

However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster. We demonstrate Maast’s utility on species with thousands of genomes by reconstructing the genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori across the globe and tracking SARS-CoV-2 diversification during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Here, we show that the genetic structure of the human gut microbiome provides unique opportunities to measure individual recombination events directly, enabling quantitative comparisons of recombination across a diverse range of species that inhabit a common environment. By analyzing a large collection of recent recombination events in the core genomes of 29 gut commensals, we uncovered systematic heterogeneities in the rates and lengths of transferred segments, which are difficult to explain by existing models of ecological isolation or reduced efficiencies of recombination.

Effector domains within these proteins can activate or repress transcription. However, for many of these regulators we do not know what type of transcriptional effector domains they contain, their location in the protein, their activation and repression strengths, and the amino acids that are necessary for their functions. Here, we systematically measure the transcriptional effector activity of >100,000 protein fragments (each 80 amino acids long) tiling across most chromatin regulators and transcription factors in human cells (2,047 proteins). By testing the effect they have when recruited at reporter genes, we annotate 307 new activation domains and 592 new repression domains, a ∼5-fold increase over the number of previously annotated effectors3,4. Complementary rational mutagenesis and deletion scans across all the effector domains reveal aromatic and/or leucine residues interspersed with acidic, proline, serine, and/or glutamine residues are necessary for activation domain activity. Additionally, the majority of repression domain sequences contain either sites for SUMOylation, short interaction motifs for recruiting co-repressors, or are structured binding domains for recruiting other repressive proteins. Surprisingly, we discover bifunctional domains that can both activate and repress and can dynamically split a cell population into high- and low-expression subpopulations. Our systematic annotation and characterization of transcriptional effector domains provides a rich resource for understanding the function of human transcription factors and chromatin regulators, engineering compact tools for controlling gene expression, and refining predictive computational models of effector domain function.",,10.1101/2022.08.26.505496,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.26.505496v1,2022.08.26.505496,08/26/2022,,08/26/2022,"Biophysics Program, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University","Biophysics Program, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Biophysics Program, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University",,,1.0,,

We describe a method forphenotype recognition that imputes phenotype codes for all UK Biobankparticipants. Materials and Methods POPDx (Population-based ObjectivePhenotyping by Deep Extrapolation) is a bilinear machine learning framework forsimultaneously estimating the probabilities of 1,538 phenotype codes. Weextracted phenotypic and health-related information of 392,246 individuals fromthe UK Biobank for POPDx development and evaluation. A total of 12,803 ICD-10diagnosis codes of the patients were converted to 1,538 Phecodes as goldstandard labels. The POPDx framework was evaluated and compared to otheravailable methods on automated multi-phenotype recognition. Results POPDx canpredict phenotypes that are rare or even unobserved in training. We demonstratesubstantial improvement of automated multi-phenotype recognition across 22disease categories, and its application in identifying key epidemiologicalfeatures associated with each phenotype.

MERFISH produces an intrinsically different data type than scRNA-seq and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas as well as from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

Here, we identify a new protist species, Tritrichomonas casperi, and show that metabolic differences between closely related commensal protists modulate their effects on host immunity and determine their ecological niche within the murine microbiota. Genomic and metabolomic analysis of commensal tritrichomonads reveal species-level differences in excretion of the tuft cell activating metabolite succinate, leading to differential induction of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells in the small intestine. Using defined diets and in vitro growth assays, we show that different tritrichomonad species preferentially rely on dietary polysaccharides or mucus glycans, which leads to trans-kingdom competition with specific bacteria in the microbiota. Our findings elucidate differences in commensal tritrichomonad metabolism and suggest how dietary interventions could regulate the impact of these protists on gut health.",,10.1101/2022.08.26.505490,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.26.505490v1,2022.08.26.505490,08/27/2022,,08/27/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, (Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine), Stanford University","Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Pediatrics, (Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine), Stanford University; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

To better understand the role of long-range interactions between distal regulatory elements during the early transformation from healthy colon to colorectal cancer, here we performed high resolution chromatin conformation capture for 33 samples including non-neoplastic mucosa, adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinomas, mostly from Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients. We identified hundreds of thousands of chromatin micro-structures, such as architectural stripes and loops, which originated from active cis-regulatory elements. Surprisingly, these structures progressively decayed throughout cancer progression, particularly at promoters. Meta-analyses revealed that this decay was independent of alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. Interestingly, the degree of interaction loss was poorly correlated with gene expression changes. Instead, genes whose expression were disproportionately lower and higher than their relative promoter interaction in mucosa shifted their expression in polyps and adenocarcinomas to yield a more direct relationship between strength of interaction and gene expression. Our work provides the first high resolution 3D conformation maps during early cancer formation and progression, and provides novel insights into transcriptional readouts associated with fine-scale chromatin conformation alterations.",,10.1101/2022.08.26.505505,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.26.505505v1,2022.08.26.505505,08/27/2022,,08/27/2022,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine; Ultima Genomics","Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Ultima Genomics; Ultima Genomics; Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine; Ultima Genomics; Ultima Genomics; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine",,,1.0,,

Invariably, at least one member of the perilipin family of proteins (PLIN1-5) associates with LDs in all cell types. Despite key roles of PLIN2 in governing hepatic lipid metabolism, the mechanisms that regulate PLIN2 levels remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a set of genome-edited PLIN2 reporter cell lines that facilitate the analysis of genes that regulate PLIN2 and LD abundance. Leveraging these reporter cells in a series of CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens, we generate a comprehensive inventory of genes that influence PLIN2 levels under different metabolic conditions. Moreover, we uncouple their effects on PLIN2 expression and post-translational stability. Identified genetic modifiers include canonical genes that control LD metabolism (e.g., ACSL3, DGAT2, PNPLA2, ABHD5) as well as genes with less characterized roles in PLIN2 and LD regulation such as ubiquitination machinery (e.g., MARCH6, UBE2J2), transcription regulators (e.g., HNF4A, HDAC3), mitochondrial pathways (e.g., electron transport chain and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis), and others. These CRISPR screens, and several published screens that focus on different aspects of lipid metabolism, provide the foundation for CRISPRlipid (http://crisprlipid.org), a versatile, online data commons for lipid-related functional genomics data.

Existing clinical imaging techniques are frequently unable to distinguish infection from tumors or sterile inflammation. This challenge is well-illustrated by prosthetic joint infections that often complicate joint replacements. D-methyl-11C-methionine (D-11C-Met) is a new bacteria-specific PET radiotracer, based on an amino acid D-enantiomer, that is rapidly incorporated into the bacterial cell wall. In this manuscript, we describe the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and initial human experience using D-11C-Met in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infections.              Methods:                    614.5 ± 100.2 MBq of D-11C-Met was synthesized using an automated in-loop radiosynthesis method and administered to six healthy volunteers and five patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection, who were studied by PET/MRI. Time-activity curves were used to calculate residence times for each source organ. Absorbed doses to each organ and body effective doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 with both ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors. SUVmax and SUVpeak were calculated for volumes of interest (VOIs) in joints with suspected infection, the unaffected contralateral joint, blood pool, and soft tissue background. A two-tissue compartment model was used for kinetic modeling.              Results:                    D-11C-Met was well tolerated in all subjects. The tracer showed clearance from both urinary (rapid) and hepatobiliary (slow) pathways as well as low effective doses. Moreover, minimal background was observed in both organs with resident micro-flora and target organs, such as the spine and musculoskeletal system. Additionally, D-11C-Met showed increased focal uptake in areas of suspected infection, demonstrated by a significantly higher SUVmax and SUVpeak calculated from VOIs of joints with suspected infections compared to the contralateral joints, blood pool, and background (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher distribution volume and binding potential were observed in suspected infections compared to the unaffected joints.              Conclusion:                    D-11C-Met has a favorable radiation profile, minimal background uptake, and fast urinary extraction. Furthermore, D-11C-Met showed increased uptake in areas of suspected infection, making this a promising approach.

We therefore assessed rural-urban differences in diabetes care and control in LMICs.              Research design and methods:                    We pooled individual-level data from nationally representative health surveys in 42 countries. We used Poisson regression models to estimate age-adjusted differences in the proportion of individuals with diabetes in rural versus urban areas achieving performance measures for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risk factors. We examined differences across the pooled sample, by sex, and by country.              Results:                    The pooled sample from 42 countries included 840,110 individuals (35,404 with diabetes). Compared with urban populations with diabetes, rural populations had ∼15-30% lower relative risk of achieving performance measures for diabetes diagnosis and treatment. Rural populations with diagnosed diabetes had a 14% (95% CI 5-22%) lower relative risk of glycemic control, 6% (95% CI -5 to 16%) lower relative risk of blood pressure control, and 23% (95% CI 2-39%) lower relative risk of cholesterol control. Rural women with diabetes had lower achievement of performance measures relating to control than urban women, whereas among men, differences were small.              Conclusions:                    Rural populations with diabetes experience substantial inequities in the achievement of diabetes performance measures in LMICs.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.

Endogenous ligands for PPARγ are generated during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to fatty acids through the actions of lipases such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). To examine whether reduced production of endogenous PPARγ ligands would influence bone regeneration, we examined the effects of HSL knockout on fracture repair in mice using a tibial mono-cortical defect as a model. We found an improved rate of fracture repair in HSL-ko mice documented by serial μCT and bone histomorphometry compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, accelerated rates of bone regeneration were observed with a calvarial model where implantation of bone grafts from HSL-ko mice accelerated bone regeneration at the injury site. Further analysis revealed improved MSC differentiation down osteoblast and chondrocyte lineage with inhibition of HSL. MSC recruitment to the injury site was greater in HSL-ko mice than WT. Finally, we used single cell RNAseq to understand the osteoimmunological differences between WT and HSL-ko mice and found changes in the pre-osteoclast population. Our study shows HSL-ko mice as an interesting model to study improvements to bone injury repair. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential importance of pre-osteoclasts and osteoclasts in bone repair.

Targeted gene editing has the potential to overcome these limitations and enhance T cell therapeutic function3-10. Here we performed multiple genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens under different immunosuppressive conditions to identify genes that can be targeted to prevent T cell dysfunction. These screens converged on RASA2, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) that we identify as a signalling checkpoint in human T cells, which is downregulated upon acute T cell receptor stimulation and can increase gradually with chronic antigen exposure. RASA2 ablation enhanced MAPK signalling and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell cytolytic activity in response to target antigen. Repeated tumour antigen stimulations in vitro revealed that RASA2-deficient T cells show increased activation, cytokine production and metabolic activity compared with control cells, and show a marked advantage in persistent cancer cell killing. RASA2-knockout CAR T cells had a competitive fitness advantage over control cells in the bone marrow in a mouse model of leukaemia. Ablation of RASA2 in multiple preclinical models of T cell receptor and CAR T cell therapies prolonged survival in mice xenografted with either liquid or solid tumours. Together, our findings highlight RASA2 as a promising target to enhance both persistence and effector function in T cell therapies for cancer treatment.",36002574,10.1038/s41586-022-05126-w.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9433322/,,08/24/2022,09/2022,09/01/2022,"1 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. julia.carnevale@ucsf.edu.2 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. julia.carnevale@ucsf.edu.3 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. julia.carnevale@ucsf.edu.4 Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. julia.carnevale@ucsf.edu.5 Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, CA, USA. eric.shifrut@ucsf.edu.6 The School of Neurobiology, Biochemistry and Biophysics, The George S.

We combine multiplexed CRISPRi screening with machine learning to define quantitative enhancer-enhancer interactions. We find that the ultralong distance enhancer network has a nested multilayer architecture that confers functional robustness of gene expression. Experimental characterization reveals that enhancer epistasis is maintained by three-dimensional chromosomal interactions and BRD4 condensation. Machine learning prediction of synergistic enhancers provides an effective strategy to identify noncoding variant pairs associated with pathogenic genes in diseases beyond genome-wide association studies analysis.

With an aim of further understanding sex chromosome turnover, we investigated the polymorphic sex chromosomes of the Marsabit clawed frog, Xenopus borealis, using genomic data and a new chromosome-scale genome assembly. We confirmed previous findings that 54.1 Mb of chromosome 8L is sex-linked in animals from east Kenya and a laboratory strain, but most (or all) of this region is not sex-linked in natural populations from west Kenya. Previous work suggests possible degeneration of the Z chromosomes in the east population because many sex-linked transcripts of this female heterogametic population have female-biased expression, and we therefore expected this chromosome to not be present in the west population. In contrast, our simulations support a model where most or all of the sex-linked portion of the Z chromosome from the east acquired autosomal segregation in the west, and where much genetic variation specific to the large sex-linked portion of the W chromosome from the east is not present in the west. These recent changes are consistent with the hot-potato model, wherein sex chromosome turnover is favoured by natural selection if it purges a (minimally) degenerate sex-specific sex chromosome, but counterintuitively suggest natural selection failed to purge a Z chromosome that has signs of more advanced and possibly more ancient regulatory degeneration. These findings highlight complex evolutionary dynamics of young, rapidly evolving Xenopus sex chromosomes and set the stage for mechanistic work aimed at pinpointing additional sex-determining genes in this group.
