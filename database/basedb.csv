Harms",biorxiv,Evolution avoids a pathological stabilizing interaction in the immune protein S100A9,"Stability constrains evolution. While much is known about constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently identified a mutation in the innate immune protein S100A9 that provides insight into such constraints. When introduced into human S100A9, M63F simultaneously increases the stability of the protein and disrupts its natural ability to activate Toll-like receptor 4. Using chemical denaturation, we found that M63F stabilizes a calcium-bound conformation of hS100A9. We then used NMR to solve the structure of the mutant protein, revealing that the mutation distorts the hydrophobic binding surface of hS100A9, explaining its deleterious effect on function. Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments revealed stabilization of the region around M63F in the structure, notably Phe37. In the structure of the M63F mutant, the Phe37 and Phe63 sidechains are in contact, plausibly forming an edge-face ν-stack. Mutating Phe37 to Leu abolished the stabilizing effect of M63F as probed by both chemical denaturation and HDX. It also restored the biological activity of S100A9 disrupted by M63F. These findings reveal that Phe63 creates a “molecular staple” with Phe37 that stabilizes a non-functional conformation of the protein, thus disrupting function. Using a bioinformatic analysis, we found that S100A9 proteins from different organisms rarely have Phe at both positions 37 and 63, suggesting that avoiding a pathological stabilizing interaction indeed constrains S100A9 evolution. This work highlights an important evolutionary constraint on stabilizing mutations: they must avoid inappropriately stabilizing non-functional protein conformations.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Protein stability constrains protein evolution. While much is known about evolutionary constraints on destabilizing mutations, less is known about the constraints on stabilizing mutations. We recently found a mutation to an innate immune protein that increases its stability but disrupts its function. Here we show, through careful biophysical and functional studies, that this mutation stabilizes a nonfunctional form of the protein through a direct interaction with another amino acid. We find that specific amino acids can be tolerated at each of the interacting positions individually, but not at both simultaneously. This pattern has been conserved over millions of years of evolution. Our work highlights an underappreciated evolutionary constraint on stabilizing mutations: they must avoid inappropriately stabilizing non-functional protein conformations.",,10.1101/2022.05.09.490804,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.09.490804v1,2022.05.09.490804,5/9/2022,,,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oregon; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon; College of Science; Oregon State University; Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oregon; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oregon; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oregon; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California Berkeley; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oregon; Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon",,,0,,

Cells and the enzymes that comprise them respond to temperature fluctuations on short timescales, and temperature can affect protein folding, the molecular composition of cells, and volume expansion. Entire ecosystems exhibit temperature-dependent behaviors, and global warming threatens to disrupt thermal homeostasis in microbes that are important for human and planetary health. Intriguingly, the growth rate of most species follows the Arrhenius law of equilibrium thermodynamics, with an activation energy similar to that of individual enzymes but with maximal growth rates and over temperature ranges that are species specific. In this review, we discuss how the temperature dependence of critical cellular processes, such as the central dogma and membrane fluidity, contributes to the temperature dependence of growth. We conclude with a discussion of adaptation to temperature shifts and the effects of temperature on evolution and on the properties of microbial ecosystems.

Here we show healthy human lung slices cultured ex vivo can be productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the cellular tropism of the virus and its distinct and dynamic effects on host cell gene expression can be determined by single cell RNA sequencing and reconstruction of “infection pseudotime” for individual lung cell types. This revealed the prominent SARS-CoV-2 target is a population of activated interstitial macrophages, which as infection proceeds accumulate thousands of viral RNA molecules per cell, comprising up to 60% of the cellular transcriptome and including canonical and novel subgenomic RNAs. During viral takeover, there is cell-autonomous induction of a specific host interferon program and seven chemokines (CCL2, 7, 8, 13, CXCL10) and cytokines (IL6, IL10), distinct from the response of alveolar macrophages in which neither viral takeover nor induction of a substantial inflammatory response occurs. Using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, we show that entry into purified human lung macrophages depends on Spike but is not blocked by cytochalasin D or by an ACE2-competing monoclonal antibody, indicating a phagocytosis- and ACE2-independent route of entry. These results provide a molecular characterization of the initiation of COVID-19 in human lung tissue, identify activated interstitial macrophages as a prominent site of viral takeover and focus of inflammation, and suggest targeting of these macrophages and their signals as a new therapeutic modality for COVID-19 pneumonia and progression to ARDS. Our approach can be generalized to define the initiation program and evaluate therapeutics for any human lung infection at cellular resolution.",,10.1101/2022.05.10.491266,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.10.491266v1,2022.05.10.491266,5/10/2022,,,"Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Program in Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Program in Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Program in Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine; Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Pediatrics, Pulmonary Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine; Program in Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Vera Moulton Wall Center for Pulmonary Vascular Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, San Francisco",,,0,,

We developed a precision-cut lung slice model to investigate very early host-viral pathogenesis and found that SARS-CoV-2 had a rapid and specific tropism for myeloid populations in the human lung. Infection of alveolar macrophages was partially dependent upon their expression of ACE2, and the infections were productive for amplifying virus, both findings which were in contrast with their neutralization of another pandemic virus, Influenza A virus (IAV). Compared to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 was extremely poor at inducing interferon-stimulated genes in infected myeloid cells, providing a window of opportunity for modest titers to amplify within these cells. Endotracheal aspirate samples from humans with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 confirmed the lung slice findings, revealing a persistent myeloid depot. In the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, myeloid cells may provide a safe harbor for the virus with minimal immune stimulatory cues being generated, resulting in effective viral colonization and quenching of the immune system.",,10.1101/2022.04.28.489942,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.28.489942v2,2022.04.28.489942,5/11/2022,,,"Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; CoLabs Initiative, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; CoLabs Initiative, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Pathology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Department of Anatomy, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California; Gladstone Institutes; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Pathology, University of California; Department of Medicine, University of California",,,0,,

A growing body of evidence supports their potential health benefits, but the mechanistic basis of their effects on the gut microbiome and host immunity remain to be elucidated. Fermented foods are diverse, each representing a complex mixture of food, microbes, and metabolites creating a significant challenge to disentangle the effects of individual components. Herein, we further define the chemical signature of individual fermented foods to categorize them based on the primary metabolic end-products of fermentation. Using mouse models, we find that fermented foods have both microbiome directed as well as differential host directed effects that correspond to their metabolite composition. Fermented food brine drink shows site-specific restructuring of the gut microbiome and promotion of tolerogenic barrier immunity; fractionation of the brine to examine the effects of the microbe-free, metabolite rich supernatant shows similar activity. Lactate, the main metabolite of lactic acid fermentation and the major metabolite within the brine drink, when administered in water, fuels a trans-kingdom metabolic network to selectively promote the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila. in the small intestine, while promoting immune tolerance via an increase in microbiota-dependent Regulatory T-cells. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of fermented food consumption can be mediated by microbial metabolites within fermented foods, independent of microbial content, and highlight the importance of further defining the diverse chemical landscape of fermented foods to inform their potential health benefits and therapeutic use.",,10.1101/2022.05.11.490523,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.11.490523v1,2022.05.11.490523,5/12/2022,,,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Departments of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Center for Human Microbiome Studies, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces an intrinsically different data type than scRNA-seq methods and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We used the Vizgen MERSCOPE platform to perform MERFISH on mouse liver and kidney tissues and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the existing Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas. We found that MERFISH produced measurements that quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results, with some minor differences in overall gene dropout rates and single-cell transcript count statistics. Finally, we explored MERFISH’s ability to identify cell types, and found that it could independently resolve distinct cell types and spatial structure in both liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas using scVI and scANVI did not noticeably enhance these results. We conclude that compared to scRNA-seq, MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for measuring single-cell gene expression, and that efficient gene panel design allows for robust cell type identification with intact spatial information without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq reference atlases.",,10.1101/2022.03.04.483068,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.04.483068v2,2022.03.04.483068,5/13/2022,,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; School of Medicine, University of California; School of Medicine, University of California; School of Medicine, University of California; Vizgen Inc; Vizgen Inc; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

However, whether specific astrocytic outputs follow specific GPCR activity remains unclear, and exploring this question is critical for understanding how astrocytes ultimately influence brain function and behavior. We previously showed that astrocytic Gi-GPCR activation is sufficient to increase slow-wave neural activity (SWA) during sleep when activated in cortical astrocytes1. Here, we investigate the outputs of astrocytic Gi-GPCRs, focusing on the regulation of extracellular glutamate and GABA, by combining in vivo fiber photometry recordings of the extracellular indicators iGluSnFR and iGABASnFR with astrocyte-specific chemogenetic Gi-GPCR activation. We find that Gi-GPCR activation does not change spontaneous dynamics of extracellular glutamate or GABA. However, Gi-GPCR activation does specifically increase visual stimulus-evoked extracellular glutamate. Together, these data point towards a complex relationship between astrocytic inputs and outputs in vivo that may depend on behavioral context. Further, they suggest an extracellular glutamate-specific mechanism underlying some astrocytic Gi-GPCR-dependent behaviors, including the regulation of sleep SWA.",,10.1101/2022.05.12.491656,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.12.491656v1,2022.05.12.491656,5/13/2022,,,"Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

However, whether more actin assembles at endocytic sites in response to increased load has not previously been investigated. Here actin network ultrastructure at CME sites was examined under low and high membrane tension. Actin and N-WASP spatial organization indicate that actin polymerization initiates at the base of clathrin-coated pits and that the network then grows away from the plasma membrane. Actin network height at individual CME sites was not coupled to coat shape, raising the possibility that local differences in mechanical load feed back on assembly. By manipulating membrane tension and Arp2/3 complex activity, we tested the hypothesis that actin assembly at CME sites increases in response to elevated load. Indeed, in response to elevated membrane tension, actin grew higher, resulting in greater coverage of the clathrin coat, and CME slowed. When membrane tension was elevated and the Arp2/3 complex was inhibited, shallow clathrin-coated pits accumulated, indicating that this adaptive mechanism is especially crucial for coat curvature generation. We propose that actin assembly increases in response to increased load to ensure CME robustness over a range of plasma membrane tensions.",35389747,10.1091/mbc.E21-11-0589.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9265150/,,4/7/2022,5/15/2022,,,,2022 May 15;33(6):ar50.,0,,

Although the current preclinical pipeline is well stocked with novel candidates, the last U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antibiotic with a novel mechanism of action against Gram-negative bacteria was discovered nearly 60 years ago. Of all the antibiotic candidates that initiated investigational new drug (IND) applications in the 2000s, 17% earned FDA approval within 12 years, while an overwhelming 62% were discontinued in that time frame. These ""leaks"" in the clinical pipeline, where compounds with clinical potential are abandoned during clinical development, indicate that scientific innovations are not reaching the clinic and providing benefits to patients. This is true for not only novel candidates but also candidates from existing antibiotic classes with clinically validated targets. By identifying the sources of the leaks in the clinical pipeline, future developmental efforts can be directed toward strategies that are more likely to flow into clinical use. In this review, we conduct a detailed failure analysis of clinical candidates with Gram-negative activity that have fallen out of the clinical pipeline over the past decade. Although limited by incomplete data disclosure from companies engaging in antibiotic development, we attempt to distill the developmental challenges faced by each discontinued candidate.

Here, we introduce Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP), which combines artificial-intelligence-driven image analysis of cellular phenotypes with automated single-cell or single-nucleus laser microdissection and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. DVP links protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while preserving spatial context. By individually excising nuclei from cell culture, we classified distinct cell states with proteomic profiles defined by known and uncharacterized proteins. In an archived primary melanoma tissue, DVP identified spatially resolved proteome changes as normal melanocytes transition to fully invasive melanoma, revealing pathways that change in a spatial manner as cancer progresses, such as mRNA splicing dysregulation in metastatic vertical growth that coincides with reduced interferon signaling and antigen presentation.

Diet, in particular the microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fiber, is one of the most powerful ways to affect the composition and metabolic output of the gut microbiome. As such, diet is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of C. difficile and for developing alternative approaches for coping with this pathogen. One prominent class of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic end products of MAC metabolism. SCFAs are known decrease the fitness of C. difficile in vitro and that high intestinal SCFA concentrations are associated with reduced fitness of C. difficile in animal models of C. difficile infection (CDI). Here, we use controlled dietary conditions (8 diets that differ only by MAC composition) to show that C. difficile fitness is most consistently impacted by butyrate, rather than the other two prominent SCFAs (acetate and propionate), during murine model CDI. We similarly show that butyrate concentrations are lower in fecal samples from humans with CDI relative to healthy controls. Finally, we demonstrate that butyrate impacts growth in diverse C. difficile isolates. These findings provide a foundation for future work which will dissect how butyrate directly impacts C. difficile fitness and will lead to the development of diverse approaches distinct from antibiotics or fecal transplant, such as dietary interventions, for mitigating CDI in at-risk human populations.IMPORTANCE Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea in humans and it imposes a tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Current treatments for C. difficile infection (CDI) include antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, which contribute to recurrent CDIs and face major regulatory hurdles, respectively. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop new ways to cope with CDI. Notably, a disrupted “dysbiotic” gut microbiota is the primary risk factor for CDI but we incompletely understand how a healthy microbiota resists CDI. Here, we show that a specific molecule produced by the gut microbiota, butyrate, is negatively associated with C. difficile burdens in humans and in a mouse model of CDI and that butyrate impedes the growth of diverse C. difficile strains in pure culture. These findings help to build a foundation for designing alternative, possibly diet-based, strategies for mitigating CDI in humans.",,10.1101/2022.05.20.492898,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.20.492898v1,2022.05.20.492898,5/21/2022,,,"Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Interface Biosciences Inc; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of California; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Chemical Glycobiology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute and Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Abbott, Nutrition Division; Abbott, Nutrition Division; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0,,

However, most current photo-responsive DNA switches are limited either by irreversible switching or reversible switching with impractically slow kinetics. Here, we report the design of an intramolecular triplex photoswitch (TPS) design based on single-stranded DNA that undergoes rapid and reversible photoswitching between folded and unfolded states through isomerization of internal azobenzene modifications. After optimizing the performance of our photoswitch design, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how individual azobenzenes contribute to the stabilization or destabilization of the triplex depending on their photoisomerization state. By coupling our TPS to an existing aptamer, we can reversibly modulate its binding affinity with less than 15 seconds of UV light exposure. We further demonstrate reproducible shifting in affinity over multiple cycles of UV and blue light irradiation without substantial photobleaching. Given that our TPS can introduce switching functionality to aptamers without manipulating the aptamer sequence itself, we believe our design methodology should offer a versatile means for integrating photo-responsive properties into DNA nanostructures.",,10.1101/2022.05.22.492975,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.22.492975v1,2022.05.22.492975,5/22/2022,,,"Department of Radiology, Stanford University; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Radiology, Stanford University; Department of Chemistry, The University of Vermont; Department of Radiology, Stanford University; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University",,,0,,

Still, optimal combination, order, and timing of administration remains under investigation. Here, we measure how MEK inhibition (MEKi) alters anti-tumor immunity by utilizing quantitative immunopeptidomics to profile changes in the peptide MHC (pMHC) repertoire. These data reveal a collection of tumor antigens whose presentation levels are selectively augmented following therapy, including several epitopes present at over 1000 copies-per-cell. We leveraged the tunable abundance of MEKi-modulated antigens by targeting 4 epitopes with pMHC-specific T cell engagers and antibody drug conjugates, enhancing cell killing in tumor cells following MEK inhibition. These results highlight drug treatment as a means to enhance immunotherapy efficacy by targeting specific upregulated pMHCs and provide a methodological framework for identifying, quantifying, and therapeutically targeting additional epitopes of interest.SIGNIFICANCE Kinase inhibitor treatment in NRAS/BRAF mutant melanoma can sensitize tumors to immunotherapy, in part through an increase in average surface presentation of peptide MHC molecules.

Testing with BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests was available regardless of age, vaccine status, or symptoms throughout.Main Outcomes and Measures We characterized the prevalence of specific symptoms for people with a positive BinaxNOW test during the Omicron period and compared it to the pre-Delta and Delta periods. During the Omicron period, we examined differences in symptoms by age and vaccine status. Among people returning for repeat testing during Omicron period, we estimated the proportion with a positive BinaxNOW antigen test between 4-14 days from symptom onset or since first positive test if asymptomatic.Results Of 63,277 persons tested, 18,301 (30%) reported symptoms and 4,568 (25%) tested positive for COVID-19. During the Omicron period, 41.6% (3032/7283) of symptomatic testers tested positive, and the proportion reporting cough (67.4%) and sore throat (43.4%) was higher than during Delta and pre-Delta periods. Congestion was higher during Omicron (38.8%) than during the pre-Delta period and loss of taste/smell (5.3%) and fever (30.4%) were less common. Fevers and myalgias were less common among persons who had received boosters compared to unvaccinated people or those who received the primary series. Five days after symptom onset, 31.1% of people with COVID-19 stated their symptoms were similar or worsening. An estimated 80.2% of symptomatic re-testers remained positive five days after symptom onset and 60.5% after ten days.Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 upper respiratory tract symptoms were more commonly reported during the Omicron period compared to pre-Delta and Delta periods, with differences by vaccination status. Antigen test positivity remained high after 5 days, supporting guidelines requiring a negative test to shorten the isolation period.Question During the Omicron period, are there differences in COVID-19 symptomatology compared to the pre-Delta and Delta periods and how long do rapid antigen tests remain positive?Findings In this community-based surveillance study we detected differences in symptomatology between the Omicron period and prior variant-periods, and by age and vaccination status. Five days after symptom onset, 80% remained positive with a BinaxNOW test.Meaning During the Omicron period, differences in symptomatology may be due to rising population immunity and a new variant.

Deep generative models have been extensively applied to scRNA-seq data, with a special focus on embedding cells into a low-dimensional latent space and correcting for batch effects. However, little attention has been given to the problem of utilizing the uncertainty from the deep generative model for differential expression. Furthermore, the existing approaches do not allow controlling for the effect size or the false discovery rate. Here, we present lvm-DE, a generic Bayesian approach for performing differential expression from using a fitted deep generative model, while controlling the false discovery rate.

By single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of over 20,000 differentiating white and brown preadipocytes, we constructed a high-resolution temporal transcriptional landscape of human white and brown adipogenesis. White and brown preadipocytes were isolated from a single individual’s neck region, thereby eliminating inter-subject variability across two distinct lineages. These preadipocytes were also immortalized to allow for controlled, in vitro differentiation, allowing sampling of distinct cellular states across the spectrum of adipogenic progression. Pseudotemporal cellular ordering revealed the dynamics of ECM remodeling during early adipogenesis, and lipogenic/thermogenic response during late white/brown adipogenesis. Comparison with adipogenic regulation in murine models revealed several targets for potential adipogenic/thermogenic drivers in humans. Key adipogenic and lipogenic markers revealed in our analysis were applied to analyze publicly available scRNA-seq datasets; these confirmed unique cell maturation features in recently discovered murine preadipocytes, and revealed inhibition of adipogenic expansion in humans with obesity.

When applied to human gut commensals, our framework revealed that resource competition alone could explain most pairwise interactions. The resource-competition landscape inferred from metabolomic profiles of individual species predicted assembly compositions, demonstrating that resource competition is a dominant driver of in vitro community assembly. Moreover, the identification and incorporation of interactions other than resource competition, including pH-mediated effects and cross-feeding, improved model predictions.

Kearns, Kerwyn Casey Huang",biorxiv,Fatty acid synthesis knockdown promotes biofilm wrinkling and inhibits sporulation in Bacillus subtilis,"Many bacterial species typically live in complex three-dimensional biofilms, yet little is known about systematic changes to gene function between non-biofilm and biofilm lifestyles. Here, we created a CRISPRi library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain 3610. We show that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. We developed an image analysis algorithm to quantify biofilm colony wrinkling, which identified strains with high or low levels of wrinkling that were uncorrelated with extracellular matrix gene expression. We also designed a high-throughput screen for sensitive quantification of sporulation efficiency and performed the first screens of sporulation during essential gene knockdown. We found that all basal knockdowns of essential genes were competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but certain strains exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased wrinkling and inhibited sporulation. These results highlight the importance of essential genes in biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes. Importance For many bacteria, life typically involves growth in dense, three-dimensional communities called biofilms that contain cells with differentiated roles and are held together by extracellular matrix. To examine how gene function varies between non-biofilm and biofilm growth, we created a comprehensive library of strains using CRISPRi to knockdown expression of each essential gene in the model species Bacillus subtilis 3610, which can develop into a wrinkled biofilm structure or a spore capable of surviving harsh environments. This library enabled us to determine when gene essentiality depends on growth conditions. We also developed high-throughput assays and computational algorithms to identify essential genes involved in biofilm wrinkling and sporulation. Knockdown of fatty acid synthesis increased the density of wrinkles, and also inhibited sporulation in a medium with generally lower sporulation levels.

Etv2 is a master transcriptional regulator required for the development of both lineages. However, the mechanisms through which Etv2 initiates the gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) for endothelial and erythropoietic specification and how the two GRNs diverge downstream of Etv2 remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing a hypomorphic Etv2 mutant, we demonstrate different threshold requirements for initiation of the downstream GRNs for endothelial and erythropoietic development. We show that Etv2 functions directly in a coherent feedforward transcriptional network for vascular endothelial development, and a low level of Etv2 expression is sufficient to induce and sustain the endothelial GRN. In contrast, Etv2 induces the erythropoietic GRN indirectly via activation of Tal1, which requires a significantly higher threshold of Etv2 to initiate and sustain erythropoietic development.

To address these limitations, we developed directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq), which uses antibody-tethered enzymes to methylate DNA near a target protein's binding sites in situ. These exogenous methylation marks are then detected simultaneously with endogenous CpG methylation on unamplified DNA using long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies. We optimized and benchmarked DiMeLo-seq by mapping chromatin-binding proteins and histone modifications across the human genome. Furthermore, we identified where centromere protein A localizes within highly repetitive regions that were unmappable with short sequencing reads, and we estimated the density of centromere protein A molecules along single chromatin fibers.

Our aim was to characterize early sepsis ex vivo functional immune response heterogeneity by studying whole blood endotoxin responses and derive a transcriptional metric of ex vivo endotoxin response.              Methods:                    Blood collected within 24 h of hospital presentation from 40 septic patients was divided into two fractions and incubated with media (unstimulated) or endotoxin. Supernatants and cells were isolated, and responses measured using: supernatant cytokines, lung endothelial permeability after supernatant exposure, and RNA expression. A transcriptomic signature was derived in unstimulated cells to predict the ex vivo endotoxin response. The signature was tested in a separate cohort of 191 septic patients to evaluate for association with clinical outcome. Plasma biomarkers were quantified to measure in vivo host inflammation.              Results:                    Ex vivo response to endotoxin varied and was unrelated to immunosuppression, white blood cell count, or the causative pathogen. Thirty-five percent of patients demonstrated a minimal response to endotoxin, suggesting early immunosuppression. High ex vivo cytokine production by stimulated blood cells correlated with increased in vitro pulmonary endothelial cell permeability and was associated with attenuated in vivo host inflammation. A four-gene signature of endotoxin response detectable without the need for a functional assay was identified. When tested in a separate cohort of septic patients, its expression was inversely associated with hospital mortality.

We reported that AAK1 and GAK control intracellular trafficking of RNA viruses and revealed a requirement for BIKE in early and late stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, the downstream targets phosphorylated by BIKE have not yet been identified. Here, to identify BIKE substrates, we conducted a barcode fusion genetics-yeast two-hybrid screen and retrieved publicly available data generated via affinity-purification mass spectrometry. We subsequently validated 19 of 47 putative BIKE interactors using mammalian cell-based protein-protein interaction assays. We found that CLINT1, a cargo-specific adapter implicated in bidirectional Golgi-to-endosome trafficking, emerged as a predominant hit in both screens. Our experiments indicated that BIKE catalyzes phosphorylation of a threonine 294 CLINT1 residue both in vitro and in cell culture. Our findings revealed that CLINT1 phosphorylation mediates its binding to the DENV nonstructural 3 protein and subsequently promotes DENV assembly and egress. Additionally, using live-cell imaging we revealed that CLINT1 cotraffics with DENV particles and is involved in mediating BIKE's role in DENV infection. Finally, our data suggest that additional cellular BIKE interactors implicated in the host immune and stress responses and the ubiquitin proteasome system might also be candidate phosphorylation substrates of BIKE. In conclusion, these findings reveal cellular substrates and pathways regulated by the understudied Numb-associated kinase enzyme BIKE, a mechanism for CLINT1 regulation, and control of DENV infection via BIKE signaling, with potential implications for cell biology, virology, and host-targeted antiviral design.

The identification of therapeutically relevant TCR-pMHC pairs is a significant bottleneck in the implementation of TCR-based immunotherapies but may be augmented by computational methodologies. The ability to computationally design TCRs to target a specific pMHC will require an automated integration of next-generation sequencing, protein-protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics (MD), and TCR ranking. We present a generic pipeline to evaluate patient-specific, sequence-based TCRs to a target pMHC. Using the three most frequently expressed TCRs from 16 colorectal cancer patients, we predicted the protein-protein structure of the TCRs to the target CEA peptide-MHC using Modeller and ColabFold. Then, these TCR-pMHC structures were compared by performing an automated molecular dynamics equilibration. ColabFold generates starting configurations that require, on average, a ~2.5X reduction in simulation time to equilibrate TCR-pMHC structures compared to Modeller. In addition, the structural differences between Modeller and ColabFold are demonstrated by an increase in root mean square deviation (~0.20 nm) between clusters of equilibrated configurations, which can impact the number of hydrogen bonds and Lennard-Jones contacts between the TCR and pMHC.

However, despite technological advances2,3 most studies of allosteric effects on function are conducted in heterologous environments2,4,5, limiting the discovery of allosteric mechanisms that rely on endogenous binding partners or posttranslational modifications to modulate activity. Here we report an approach that enables probing of new sites of allosteric regulation at residue-level resolution in essential eukaryotic proteins in their native biological context by comprehensive mutational scanning. We apply our approach to the central GTPase Gsp1/Ran. GTPases are highly regulated molecular switches that control signaling, with switching occurring via catalyzed GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. We find that 28% of 4,315 assayed mutations in Gsp1/Ran are highly deleterious, showing a toxic response identified by our assay as gain-of-function (GOF). Remarkably, a third of all positions enriched for GOF mutations (20/60) are outside the GTPase active site. Kinetic analysis shows that these distal sites are allosterically coupled to the active site, including a novel cluster of sites that alter the nucleotide preference of Gsp1 from GDP to GTP. We describe multiple distinct mechanisms by which allosteric mutations alter Gsp1/Ran cellular function by modulating GTPase switching.

Almost three decades ago, Tonerand Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, orherds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of theToner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve thegoverning equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developedformalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scatteringobstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results toanalytical solutions.

Strategies to restore MeCP2 expression phenotypically reverse RTT-like symptoms in male and female MeCP2-deficient mice3–5, suggesting that direct nuclear delivery of functional MeCP2 could restore MeCP2 activity. We report that ZF-tMeCP2, a conjugate of MeCP2(Δaa13-71, 313-484)6 and the cell-permeant mini-protein ZF5.37–11, both binds DNA in a methylation-dependent manner and reaches the nucleus of model cell lines intact at concentrations above 700 nM. When delivered to live cells, ZF-tMeCP2 engages the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex and selectively represses transcription from methylated promoters. Efficient nuclear delivery of ZF-tMeCP2 relies on a unique endosomal escape portal provided by HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion.

A remarkable example of single-cell behavior is seen in the ciliate Lacrymaria olor, which hunts by striking its prey via rapid movements and protrusions of a slender neck, many times the size of the original cell body. This dynamics of the cell neck is powered by active injection of energy into this slender filamentous structure via a coat of cilia across its length and specialized cilia at the tip. How a cell can program this dynamical active filament to produce desirable behaviors like search and homing to a target remains unknown. By constructing a coupled active-elastic and hydrodynamic model of a slender filament with activity at the tip, here we uncover how cell behavior (filament shape dynamics) can be controlled via activity dynamics. Our model captures two key features of this system - dynamic activity patterns (extension and compression cycles) and active stresses that are uniquely aligned with the filament geometry - leading to a so-called “follower force” constraint. We show that active filaments under deterministic, time-varying follower forces display rich behaviors including periodic and aperiodic shape dynamics over long times. We further show that aperiodic dynamics occur due to a transition to chaos in regions of a biologically accessible parameter space. By further dissecting the non-linear dynamics of this active filament system, we discover a simple iterative map of filament shape that predicts long-term behavior. Lastly, using these iterative maps as a design tool, we demonstrate examples of how a cell could “program” filament behaviors by using frequency and amplitude modulated activity patterns. Overall, our results serve as a framework to mechanistically understand behavior in single cells such as L. olor and present a novel chaotic dynamical system in active elastohydrodynamics.

Mechanistically understanding how this dynamic behavior emerges from underlying physical and biochemical components is an outstanding challenge.

In doing so we discover a novel route to chaos in active elastohydrodynamic systems and the first-ever description of how chaos can drive single-cell behaviors.

For indirect-developing species, there are distinct larval and adult body plans that are linked together by metamorphosis. Some outstanding questions in the development of indirect-developing organisms include the extent to which larval tissue undergoes cell death during the process of metamorphosis and when and where the tissue that will give rise to the adult originates. How do the processes of cell division and cell death redesign the body plans of indirect developers? In this study, we present patterns of cell proliferation and cell death during larval body plan development, metamorphosis, and adult body plan formation, in the hemichordate Schizocardium californium (Cameron and Perez in Zootaxa 3569:79-88, 2012) to answer these questions.              Results:                    We identified distinct patterns of cell proliferation between larval and adult body plan formation of S. californicum. We found that some adult tissues proliferate during the late larval phase prior to the start of overt metamorphosis. In addition, using an irradiation and transcriptomic approach, we describe a genetic signature of proliferative cells that is shared across the life history states, as well as markers that are unique to larval or juvenile states. Finally, we observed that cell death is minimal in larval stages but begins with the onset of metamorphosis.              Conclusions:                    Cell proliferation during the development of S. californicum has distinct patterns in the formation of larval and adult body plans. However, cell death is very limited in larvae and begins during the onset of metamorphosis and into early juvenile development in specific domains. The populations of cells that proliferated and gave rise to the larvae and juveniles have a genetic signature that suggested a heterogeneous pool of proliferative progenitors, rather than a set-aside population of pluripotent cells. Taken together, we propose that the gradual morphological transformation of S. californicum is mirrored at the cellular level and may be more representative of the development strategies that characterize metamorphosis in many metazoan animals.

Although the number of e-cigarette users has been increasing, the health impacts and biological effects of e-cigarettes are still not fully understood. Previous research has focused on the biological effects of e-cigarettes on lung cancer cell lines and distal airway epithelial cells; however, there have been few published studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on primary lung alveolar epithelial cells. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effect of e-cigarette aerosol on primary human lung alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, both alone and in the presence of viral infection. The Melo-3 atomizer caused direct AT2 cell toxicity, while the more popular Juul pod's aerosol did not have a detectable cytotoxic effect on AT2 cells. Juul nicotine aerosol also did not increase short-term susceptibility to viral infection. However, 3 days of exposure upregulated genes central to the generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and carcinogen metabolism and downregulated key innate immune system genes related to cytokine and chemokine signaling. These findings have implications for the potentially injurious impact of long-term use of popular low-power e-cigarette pods on the human alveolar epithelium.

Women (3778/4921, 76.8%; odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.32; P=.002) and those living in rural areas (3123/4065, 76.8%; odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.27; P=.03) were especially likely to hold this opinion. Most respondents preferred providing financial support through international platforms rather than directly offering support to individual countries (72.1%, 95% CI 71%-73.1%), while for vaccine products they preferred direct provision to relevant countries instead of via a delivery platform such as COVAX (77.3%, 95% CI 76.3%-78.2%).              Conclusions:                    Among our survey sample, we found that adults are generally supportive of the international distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which may encourage policy makers to support and implement the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines developed in China worldwide. Conducting similar surveys in other countries could help align policy makers' actions on COVID-19 vaccine distribution with the preferences of their constituencies.

Here we provide a detailed dissection of this using single-cell RNA-sequencing of 1.3M peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 120 individuals, longitudinally exposed to three different pathogens. These analyses indicate that cell-type-specificity is a more prominent factor than pathogen-specificity regarding contexts that affect how genetics influences gene expression (i.e., eQTL) and co-expression (i.e., co-expression QTL). In monocytes, the strongest responder to pathogen stimulations, 71.4% of the genetic variants whose effect on gene expression is influenced by pathogen exposure (i.e., response QTL) also affect the co-expression between genes. This indicates widespread, context-specific changes in gene expression level and its regulation that are driven by genetics. Pathway analysis on the CLEC12A gene that exemplifies cell-type-, exposure-time- and genetic-background-dependent co-expression interactions, shows enrichment of the interferon (IFN) pathway specifically at 3-h post-exposure in monocytes. Similar genetic background-dependent association between IFN activity and CLEC12A co-expression patterns is confirmed in systemic lupus erythematosus by in silico analysis, which implies that CLEC12A might be an IFN-regulated gene.

Using epidemiological models fit to a 19-year national dataset, we identified an overall trend of declining annual force of infection (FOI) for dengue virus (DENV) in Cambodia, interspersed with FOI spikes corresponding to epidemic year caseloads that exceeded demographic predictions. We constructed time-resolved phylogenetic trees with 105 DENV genomes sequenced from the 2019 Cambodian epidemic, paired with historical Southeast Asian data, to document the first-recorded introduction of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype into Cambodia. This introduction yielded highly localized transmission and decreased genomic diversity when compared to endemic DENV-1, supporting the hypothesis of epidemic invasion.

Gliding is thought to be powered by a thin layer of flowing filamentous (F)-actin1– 3 sandwiched between the plasma membrane and a myosin-coated4,5 inner membrane complex. How this surface actin layer drives the diverse apicomplexan gliding modes observed experimentally - helical, circular, and twirling6,7, and patch8, pendulum9, or rolling2 – presents a rich biophysical puzzle. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to track individual actin filaments and myosin complexes in live Toxoplasma gondii. Based on these data, we hypothesize that F-actin flows arise by self-organization, rather than following a microtubule-based template as previously believed. We develop a continuum model of emergent F-actin flow within the unusual confines provided by parasite geometry. In the presence of F-actin turnover, our model predicts the emergence of a steady-state mode in which actin transport is largely rearward. Removing actin turnover leads to actin patches that recirculate up and down the cell, a “cyclosis” that we observe experimentally for drug-stabilized actin bundles in live parasites. These findings provide a mechanism by which actin turnover governs a transition between distinct self-organized F-actin states, whose properties can account for the diverse gliding modes known to occur. More broadly, we illustrate how different forms of gliding motility can emerge as an intrinsic consequence of the self-organizing properties of F-actin flow in a confined geometry.",,10.1101/2022.06.08.495399,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495399v1,2022.06.08.495399,6/9/2022,,,"Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University; Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dept. of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco; National Center for X-ray Tomography, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University; Dept. of Physics, California Institute of Technology; Div. of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology; Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University",,,0,,

While some cell size control mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated through studies of cultured cells, it is unclear if and how such mechanisms control cell size in an animal. For example, it was recently shown that RB, the retinoblastoma protein, was diluted by cell growth in G1 to promote size-dependence of the G1/S transition. However, it remains unclear to what extent the RB-dilution mechanism controls cell size in an animal. We therefore examined the contribution of RB-dilution to cell size control in the mouse liver. The RB-dilution model has two requirements. First, manipulations changing RB concentration drive corresponding changes in cell size, and second, the endogenous RB concentration decreases with cell size in G1. We found that both these requirements were met. Genetic perturbations decreasing RB protein concentrations through inducible shRNA expression or through liverspecific Rb1 knockout reduced hepatocyte size, while perturbations increasing RB protein concentrations in an Fah−/− mouse model increased hepatocyte size. Moreover, RB concentration decreased in larger G1 hepatocytes while the concentrations of the cell cycle activators Cyclin D1 and E2f1 remained relatively constant. Lastly, we tested how Rb1 manipulations affected G1/S cell size control in primary hepatocytes using live cell imaging. Loss of Rb1 weakened cell size control, i.e., reduced the inverse correlation between how much cells grew in G1 and how large they were at birth. Taken together, our results show that an RB- dilution mechanism contributes to cell size control in the mouse liver by linking cell growth to the G1/S transition.",,10.1101/2022.06.08.495371,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495371v1,2022.06.08.495371,6/10/2022,,,"Department of Biology, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University; Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University; Department of Biology, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

How TMEM95 plays a role in membrane fusion of sperm and eggs has remained elusive. Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino-acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays. Strikingly, these antibodies do not block binding of sperm to eggs. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for a specific, receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs and suggest that this interaction may have a role in facilitating membrane fusion.Significance statement Membrane fusion of sperm and eggs is pivotal in sexual reproduction. Tmem95 knockout mice show male-specific sterility, but it was unknown how sperm TMEM95 facilitates membrane fusion with eggs. We show here that human TMEM95 binds eggs. Our crystal structure of TMEM95 suggests a region where this binding may occur. We develop monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that impair sperm-egg fusion but do not block sperm-egg binding. Thus, we propose that there is a receptor-mediated interaction of sperm TMEM95 with eggs, and that this interaction may have a direct role in membrane fusion.

APOBEC3 enzymes can act as potent host genome mutagens in multiple cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)3,4. There are seven human APOBEC3 family members (APOBEC3A-H) and all but one (G) preferentially deaminate TC dinucleotide substrates3. In patients, both APOBEC3A (A3A)5 and APOBEC3B (A3B)6 have been implicated to play a major role in NSCLC3. In this study, the impact of A3B on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancer evolution was assessed. EGFR mutant NSCLC mouse models containing a human A3B transgene7 were generated, and the effect of enforced A3B expression was evaluated at multiple timepoints. Enforced A3B expression was detrimental to tumour initiation and progression in the absence of targeted therapy due to elevated chromosomal instability (CIN) and p53 activation, which increased significantly in tumours with A3B expression. This finding was substantiated in the TRACERx421 study demonstrating a significant correlation between CIN and A3B in patients with NSCLC. In contrast, A3B expression with targeted therapy resulted in a significant increase in treatment resistance in mouse models and human preclinical models of EGFR mutant lung cancer. In specimens collected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma, targeted therapy upregulated A3B expression, and induced significantly more APOBEC-associated mutations including variants associated with therapy resistance. Analyses of human NSCLC models revealed that targeted therapy induced A3B upregulation in part via treatment-mediated activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signalling, and downregulation of the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG). This study uncovers the multifaceted roles of A3B on tumour evolution and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable responses to targeted cancer therapy.",,10.1101/2020.12.18.423280,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423280v3,2020.12.18.423280,6/11/2022,,,"Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute;

Molecular mimicry empowers pathogens to subvert critical host processes and establish infection. We report that the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila secretes the toxin SidI (substrate of icm/dot transporter I), which possesses a transfer RNA (tRNA)-like shape and functions as a mannosyl transferase. The 3.1 Å cryo-EM structure of SidI reveals an N-terminal domain that exhibits a characteristic ‘inverted L-shape’ and charge distribution that is present in two other known protein mimics of tRNAs, the bacterial elongation factor EF-G and the mammalian release factor eRF1. In addition, we show that SidI’s C-terminal domain adopts a glycosyl transferase B fold similar to a mannosyl transferase. This molecular coupling of the protein’s fold and enzymatic function allows SidI to bind and glycosylate components of the host translation apparatus, including the ribosome, resulting in a robust block of protein synthesis that is comparable in potency to ricin, one of the most powerful toxins known. Additionally, we find that translational pausing activated by SidI elicits a stress response signature reminiscent of the ribotoxic stress response that is activated by elongation inhibitors that induce ribosome collisions. SidI-mediated effects on the ribosome activate the stress kinases ZAKα and p38, which in turn drive an accumulation of the protein activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Intriguingly, ATF3 escapes the translation block imposed by SidI, translocates to the nucleus, and orchestrates the transcription of stress-inducible genes that promote cell death. Thus, using Legionella and its effectors as tools, we have unravelled the role of a ribosome-to-nuclear signalling pathway that regulates cell fate.",,10.1101/2022.06.10.495705,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.10.495705v3,2022.06.10.495705,6/12/2022,,,"G.W.

Although microelectrodes have been developed for long-term electrophysiological interfaces with neural tissue, studies of long-term interfaces between microelectrodes and free-floating organoids remain limited. In this study, we report a stretchable, soft mesh electrode system that establishes an intimate in vitro electrical interface with human neurons in 3D organoids. Our mesh is constructed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based electrically conductive hydrogel electrode arrays and an elastomeric poly(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (SEBS) as the substrate and encapsulation materials. This mesh electrode can maintain stable electrochemical impedance in buffer solution under 50% compressive and 50% tensile strain. We have successfully cultured pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical organoids (hCO) on this polymeric mesh for more than 3 months and demonstrated that organoids readily integrate with the mesh. Using simultaneous stimulation and calcium imaging, we show that electrical stimulation through the mesh can elicit intensity-dependent calcium signals comparable to stimulation from a bipolar stereotrode.

Current computational methods identify and measure the spatial relationships between cell-types, but do not leverage the spatial information of individual RNA molecules to reveal subcellular spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA processing. Here, we developed Bento, a computational framework for subcellular analysis of high-throughput spatial transcriptomics datasets. Bento handles single-molecule data generated by diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies and computes spatial statistics of subcellular RNA molecular distributions, compartmental expression, and cell morphology to build multidimensional feature sets for exploratory analysis. We also developed a multi-label ensemble model for generalizable classification of subcellular localization of every gene in every cell. To demonstrate Bento’s utility, we applied it to analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by seqFISH+ (10k genes in ∼200 fibroblast cells) and MERFISH (130 genes quantified in ∼1000 U2-OS cells) to understand the interplay between gene function, cellular morphology and RNA localization. To understand the role of RNA localization in RNA processing, we integrated spatial data with RNA binding protein (RBP) binding data to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of RBP-RNA interactions at unprecedented scale (3,165 RNA species x 148 RBPs). We found RNA targets of individual RBPs to be enriched in specific subcellular compartments – such as Splicing Factor 3a Protein Complex (SF3A3), and that preferential localization is influenced by RBP binding of genomic regions for RBPs including Staufen homolog 2 (STAU2). Bento builds on the existing ecosystem of single-cell and spatial analysis toolkits, to ensure accessibility and community-driven tool development.

Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq revealed the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy resistant cell subsets that was hidden by standard immunophenotyping.

These applications require stable, uniform droplets with predictable microreactor volumes. However, predicting DE droplet size, shell thickness, and stability as a function of flow rate has remained challenging for monodisperse single core droplets and those containing biologically-relevant buffers, which influence bulk and interfacial properties. As a result, developing novel DE-based bioassays has typically required extensive initial optimization of flow rates to find conditions that produce stable droplets of the desired size and shell thickness. To address this challenge, we conducted systematic size parameterization quantifying how differences in flow rates and buffer properties (viscosity and interfacial tension at water/oil interfaces) alter droplet size and stability, across 6 inner aqueous buffers used across applications such as cellular lysis, microbial growth, and drug delivery, quantifying the size and shell thickness of >22 000 droplets overall. We restricted our study to stable single core droplets generated in a 2-step dripping-dripping formation regime in a straightforward PDMS device. Using data from 138 unique conditions (flow rates and buffer composition), we also demonstrated that a recent physically-derived size law of Wang et al. can accurately predict double emulsion shell thickness for >95% of observations. Finally, we validated the utility of this size law by using it to accurately predict droplet sizes for a novel bioassay that requires encapsulating growth media for bacteria in droplets.

We found 6 complementation groups of neutralizing antibodies. 58% targeted epitopes outside the NTD supersite, 58% neutralized either Gamma or Omicron, and 14% were broad neutralizers that also neutralized Omicron. Structural characterization revealed that broadly active antibodies targeted three epitopes outside the NTD supersite including a class that recognized both the NTD and SD2 domain.

Here, we studied a cohort of 48 individuals (age 20-86 years) who received 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine and developed a breakthrough infection with hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia 2 weeks to 4 months later. Antibody levels to the vaccine, neutralization of the virus, and auto-Abs to type I IFNs were measured in the plasma. Forty-two individuals had no known deficiency of B cell immunity and a normal antibody response to the vaccine. Among them, ten (24%) had auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs (aged 43-86 years). Eight of these ten patients had auto-Abs neutralizing both IFN-α2 and IFN-ω, while two neutralized IFN-ω only. No patient neutralized IFN-β. Seven neutralized 10 ng/mL of type I IFNs, and three 100 pg/mL only. Seven patients neutralized SARS-CoV-2 D614G and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) efficiently, while one patient neutralized Delta slightly less efficiently. Two of the three patients neutralizing only 100 pg/mL of type I IFNs neutralized both D61G and Delta less efficiently.

However, these heterologous enzymes can suffer from low activity, specificity, stability and solubility in yeast, resulting in arduous iterations of design-build-test-learn cycles to optimize their production often performed on a single enzyme basis. Laboratory directed evolution has proven to be a powerful and high-throughput method for protein engineering, albeit its limited application for biosynthetic enzymes. Here, we harness small molecule-sensing, RNA-based switches to develop a generalizable selection system facilitating enzyme evolution. Our design utilizes an RNA-based switch for detection of intracellular compound production, which then regulates the expression of a selection gene. Our initial data shows that the auxotrophy selection gene SpHIS5 exhibits the highest selective capability in combination with a theophylline-responsive RNA-based switch. Using the theophylline-responsive RNA-based switch, we demonstrated the enrichment of a high-producing variant of caffeine demethylase, in a population size of 103.

Here we found in fruit fly embryos that the cytoplasm can compartmentalize and divide without nuclei. Our targeted screen for potential necessary and sufficient conditions revealed that, although the cytoplasmic compartments are tightly associated with centrosomes, they can form without astral microtubules and divide without centrioles. Although a focal pool of microtubules is necessary for maintaining cytoplasmic compartments, this is not sufficient for their initial formation. Actin filaments are similarly an essential component of cytoplasmic compartments; however, their myosin II-based contractility is unexpectedly dispensable for divisions. We show that the myosin II-based contractility is instead involved in regulating the pace of these divisions. Importantly, our results revealed that the cytoplasmic divisions without nuclei can occur in a periodic manner autonomously of the Cdk-Cyclin oscillator that normally drives the cell cycle. We demonstrate that such autonomy of cytoplasmic divisions is preserved even in normal development, where it is leveraged to extrude mitotically delayed nuclei from the blastoderm, protecting the synchrony of rapid nuclear divisions against local delays in mitotic entry.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein Perilipin-1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with controls using a specific Radioligand Binding Assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17/46; 37%) particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",35709010,10.2337/db21-1172.,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-1172,,,6/16/2022,,,,2022 Jun 16;db211172.,0,,

The anterior of the cell is marked by an array of cilia, known as the oral apparatus, which can be induced to shed and regenerate in a series of reproducible morphological steps, previously shown to require transcription. If a cell is cut in half, each half will regenerate an intact cell, including a new oral apparatus in the posterior half. We used RNAseq to assay the dynamic changes in Stentor’s transcriptome during regeneration, after both oral apparatus shedding and bisection, allowing us to identify distinct temporal waves of gene expression including kinases, RNA binding proteins, centriole biogenesis factors, and orthologs of human ciliopathy genes implicated in Meckel and Joubert syndromes. By comparing transcriptional profiles of different regeneration events in the same species, we were able to identify distinct modules of gene expression corresponding to oral apparatus regeneration, posterior holdfast regeneration, and recovery after wounding. By measuring gene expression in cells in which translation is blocked, we show that the sequential waves of gene expression involve a cascade mechanism in which later waves of expression are triggered by translation products of early-expressed genes. Among the early-expressed genes, we identified an E2F transcription factor and the conserved RNA binding protein Pumilio as potential regulators of regeneration based on the expression pattern of their predicted target genes. RNAi mediated knockdown experiments indicate that Pumilio is required for regenerating oral structures of the correct size. We show that E2F is involved in the completion of regeneration but is dispensable for earlier steps. This work allows us to classify regeneration genes into groups based on their potential role for regeneration in distinct cell regeneration paradigms, and provides insight into how a single cell can coordinate complex morphogenetic pathways to regenerate missing structures.",,10.1101/2021.06.23.449623,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.23.449623v3,2021.06.23.449623,6/19/2022,,,Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California; Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics University of California,,,0,,

While we know nearly all mammalian kinetochore proteins, how these give rise to the strong yet dynamic microtubule attachments required for function remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the Astrin-SKAP complex, which localizes to bioriented kinetochores and is essential for chromosome segregation but whose mechanical role is unclear. Live imaging reveals that SKAP depletion dampens the movement and decreases the coordination of metaphase sister kinetochores and increases the tension between them. Using laser ablation to isolate kinetochores bound to polymerizing versus depolymerizing microtubules, we show that without SKAP, kinetochores move slower on both polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules and that more force is needed to rescue microtubules to polymerize. Thus, in contrast to the previously described kinetochore proteins that increase the grip on microtubules under force, Astrin-SKAP reduces the grip, increasing attachment dynamics and force responsiveness and reducing friction. Together, our findings suggest a model where the Astrin-SKAP complex effectively ""lubricates"" correct, bioriented attachments to help preserve them.

Here, we characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in a longitudinal cohort of 109 COVID-19 outpatients enrolled during acute infection. The quality of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ response shifts from cells producing interferon gamma (IFNγ) to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) from 5 days to 4 months post-enrollment, with IFNγ-IL-21-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells the predominant population detected at later time points. Greater percentages of IFNγ-IL-21-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells on day 28 correlate with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies measured 7 months post-infection (⍴ = 0.4, p = 0.01). mRNA vaccination following SARS-CoV-2 infection boosts both IFNγ- and TNF-α-producing, spike-protein-specific CD4+ T cells.

We identified 11 distinct clusters representing renal stem cells, stellate cells, regionally specific principal cells, garland nephrocyte cells, and pericardial nephrocytes. Characterization of the transcription factors specific to each cluster identified fruitless (fru) as playing a role in stem cell regeneration and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4) in regulating glycogen and triglyceride metabolism.

Here, we interrogated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate NK cell recognition and lysis of infected cells. We found that NK cells exhibit poor cytotoxic responses against SARS-CoV-2-infected targets, preferentially killing uninfected bystander cells. We demonstrate that this escape is driven by downregulation of ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D (“NKG2D-L”). Indeed, early in viral infection, prior to NKG2D-L downregulation, NK cells are able to target and kill infected cells; however, this ability is lost as viral proteins are expressed. Finally, we found that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) mediates downregulation of NKG2D-L and that Nsp1 alone is sufficient to confer resistance to NK cell killing. Collectively, our work reveals that SARS-CoV-2 evades NK cell cytotoxicity and describes a mechanism by which this occurs.Download figureOpen in new tab",,10.1101/2022.06.20.496341,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.496341v1,2022.06.20.496341,6/21/2022,,,"Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Statistics, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Sarafan Chem-H, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0,,

We investigated immunophenotypes and cell-specific genes associated with disease activity using multiplexed RNA and protein single-cell sequencing applied to PBMCs from 4 treatment-naïve JDM (TN-JDM) subjects at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months post-treatment and 4 subjects with inactive disease on treatment. Analysis of 55,564 cells revealed separate clustering of TN-JDM cells within monocyte, NK, CD8+ effector T and naïve B populations. The proportion of CD16+ monocytes was reduced in TN-JDM, and naïve B cells and CD4+ Tregs were expanded. Cell-type differential gene expression analysis and hierarchical clustering identified a pan-cell-type IFN gene signature over-expressed in TN-JDM in all cell types and correlated with disease activity most strongly in cytotoxic cell types. TN-JDM CD16+ monocytes expressed the highest IFN gene score and were highly skewed toward an inflammatory and antigen-presenting phenotype at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. A transitional B cell population with a distinct transcriptomic signature was expanded in TN-JDM and characterized by higher CD24 and CD5 proteins and less CD39, an immunoregulatory protein.

After optimization, top-performing barcodes had ∼10-fold increased capacity relative to the best random-screened designs and performed reliably across diverse cell types. DAISY barcode arrays generated ∼12 bits of entropy and ∼66,000 unique barcodes. Thus, DAISY barcodes-at a fraction of the size of Cas9 barcodes-achieved high-capacity barcoding. We coupled DAISY barcoding with single-cell RNA-seq to recover lineages and gene expression profiles from ∼47,000 human melanoma cells.

Here, branched actin network geometry at CME sites was analyzed using three different advanced imaging approaches.

D-methyl-11C-methionine (D-11C-Met) is a new bacteria-specific PET radiotracer, based on an amino acid D-enantiomer, that is rapidly incorporated into the bacterial cell wall. In this manuscript, we describe the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and initial human experience using D-11C-Met in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infections.              Methods:                    614.5 ± 100.2 MBq of D-11C-Met was synthesized using an automated in-loop radiosynthesis method and administered to six healthy volunteers and five patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection, who were studied by PET/MRI. Time-activity curves were used to calculate residence times for each source organ. Absorbed doses to each organ and body effective doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 with both ICRP 60 and ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors. SUVmax and SUVpeak were calculated for volumes of interest (VOIs) in joints with suspected infection, the unaffected contralateral joint, blood pool, and soft tissue background. A two-tissue compartment model was used for kinetic modeling.              Results:                    D-11C-Met was well tolerated in all subjects. The tracer showed clearance from both urinary (rapid) and hepatobiliary (slow) pathways as well as low effective doses. Moreover, minimal background was observed in both organs with resident micro-flora and target organs, such as the spine and musculoskeletal system. Additionally, D-11C-Met showed increased focal uptake in areas of suspected infection, demonstrated by a significantly higher SUVmax and SUVpeak calculated from VOIs of joints with suspected infections compared to the contralateral joints, blood pool, and background (P < 0.01). Furthermore, higher distribution volume and binding potential were observed in suspected infections compared to the unaffected joints.              Conclusion:                    D-11C-Met has a favorable radiation profile, minimal background uptake, and fast urinary extraction. Furthermore, D-11C-Met showed increased uptake in areas of suspected infection, making this a promising approach. Validation in larger clinical trials with a rigorous gold standard is still required.

An open question is whether these sex differences reflect men's generally poorer health and lower life expectancy compared to women of similar ages or if men face a unique COVID-19 disadvantage. Using age-specific data on COVID-19 mortality as well as cause-specific and all-cause mortality for 63 countries, we compared the sex difference in COVID-19 mortality to sex differences in all-cause mortality and mortality from other common causes of death to determine the magnitude of the excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19. We found that sex differences in the age-standardized COVID-19 mortality rate were substantially larger than for the age-standardized all-cause mortality rate and mortality rate for most other common causes of death. The excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19 was especially large in the oldest age groups. Our findings suggest that the causal pathways that link male sex to a higher mortality from a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be specific to SARS-CoV-2, rather than shared with the pathways responsible for the shorter life expectancy among men or sex differences for other common causes of death. Understanding these causal chains could assist in the development of therapeutics and preventive measures for COVID-19 and, possibly, other coronavirus diseases.

When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.

Using synthetic biology, we engineered T cells with a chimeric receptor SyNthetic Intramembrane Proteolysis Receptor (SNIPR) that induces overexpression of an exogenous reporter gene cassette upon recognition of specific tumor markers. We then applied a SNIPR-based positron emission tomography (PET) reporter system to two cancer-relevant antigens, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), commonly expressed in breast and glial tumors respectively.

These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the near-complete 16,740 nt genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses—HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)—but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the virus’s potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover.Importance Henipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus which likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.",,10.1101/2022.06.12.495793,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.12.495793v2,2022.06.12.495793,6/24/2022,,,"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Department of Entomology, University of Antananarivo; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Medicine and Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar; Virology Department, Institut Pasteur de Dakar; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago",,,0,,

Almost three decades ago, Toner and Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, or herds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challenge faced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is the complex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic and microscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grass plains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problems analytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of the Toner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve the governing equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developed formalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scattering obstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results to analytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature, moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on a variety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients and dynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatile incorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps of parameter space. Looking forward, the work presented here lays the groundwork for a dialogue between Toner-Tu theory and data on collective motion in biologically-relevant geometries, from drone footage of migrating animal herds to movies of microscopic cytoskeletal flows within cells.",,10.1101/2022.06.22.497052,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.22.497052v1,2022.06.22.497052,6/25/2022,,,"Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University; Department of Physics, California Institute of Technology; Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology",,,0,,

Towards this goal, we deployed a customized P. falciparum PhIP-seq T7 phage display library containing 238,068 tiled 62-amino acid peptides, covering all known coding regions, including antigenic variants, to systematically profile antibody targets in 198 Ugandan children and adults from high and moderate transmission settings. Repeat elements – short amino acid sequences repeated within a protein – were significantly enriched in antibody targets. While breadth of responses to repeat-containing peptides was twofold higher in children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting, no such differences were observed for peptides without repeats, suggesting that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions may be more exposure dependent and/or less durable in children than responses to regions without repeats. Additionally, short motifs associated with seroreactivity were extensively shared among hundreds of antigens, potentially representing cross- reactive epitopes. PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens, partly driven by the diversity of PfEMP1 sequences.

The parasite evades clearance by the host immune system through antigenic variation of its dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, periodically “switching” expression of the VSG using a large genomic repertoire of VSG-encoding genes. Studies of antigenic variation in vivo have focused exclusively on parasites in the bloodstream, but recent work has shown that many, if not most, parasites are extravascular and reside in the interstitial spaces of tissues. However, it is unknown whether parasites undergo antigenic variation while in extravascular spaces. We sought to explore the dynamics of antigenic variation in extravascular parasite populations using VSG-seq, a high-throughput sequencing approach for profiling VSGs expressed in populations of T. brucei. Our experiments show that the expressed VSG repertoire is not uniform across populations of parasites within the same infection and that a greater number of VSGs are expressed in tissue spaces than in the blood. More than 75% of the VSGs detected in an animal were found exclusively within extravascular spaces. Interestingly, we also noticed a delay in the VSG-specific clearance of parasites in tissue spaces compared to the blood. This finding aligns with a model in which parasites “hide” from the immune system in tissue spaces, where a slower immune response provides them with more time to generate new antigenic variants. Overall, our results show that extravascular spaces are significant reservoirs of VSG diversity, potentially resulting from delayed clearance of tissue-resident parasites.",,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497797v1,2022.06.27.497797,6/27/2022,,,"Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Department of Neuroscience, Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, Berkeley Public Health Molecular and Cell Biology Department; Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa; Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health",,,0,,

Microbial pangenomes are created by aggregating all genomes of a single clade and reflect the metabolic diversity of groups of organisms. As de novo metagenome analysis techniques have matured and reference genome databases have expanded, metapangenome analysis has risen in popularity as a tool to organize the functional potential of organisms in relation to the environment from which those organisms were sampled. However, the reliance on assembly and binning or on reference databases often leaves substantial portions of metagenomes unanalyzed, thereby underestimating the functional potential of a community. To address this challenge, we present a method for metapangenomics that relies on amino acid k-mers (kaa-mers) and metagenome assembly graph queries. To enable this method, we first show that kaa-mers estimate pangenome characteristics and that open reading frames can be accurately predicted from short shotgun sequencing reads using the previously developed tool orpheum. These techniques enable pangenomics to be performed directly on short sequencing reads. To enable metapangenome analysis, we combine these approaches with compact de Bruijn assembly graph queries to directly generate sets of sequencing reads for a specific species from a metagenome.

However, our understanding of LCMV and its interactions with human host factors remains incomplete. Here, host determinants affecting LCMV infection were investigated through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in A549 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma line. We identified and validated a variety of novel host factors that play a functional role in LCMV infection. Among these, knockout of the sialomucin CD164, a heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein, was found to ablate infection with multiple LCMV strains but not other hemorrhagic mammarenaviruses in several cell types. Further characterization revealed a dependency of LCMV entry on the cysteine-rich domain of CD164, including an N-linked glycosylation site at residue 104 in that region. Given the documented role of LCMV with respect to transplacental human infections, CD164 expression was investigated in human placental tissue and placental cell lines. CD164 was found to be highly expressed in the cytotrophoblast cells, an initial contact site for pathogens within the placenta, and LCMV infection in placental cells was effectively blocked using a monoclonal antibody specific to the cysteine-rich domain of CD164. Together, this study identifies novel factors associated with LCMV infection of human tissues and highlights the importance of CD164, a sialomucin that previously had not been associated with viral infection. IMPORTANCE Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a human-pathogenic mammarenavirus that can be fatal in congenital infections. Although frequently used in the study of persistent infections in the field of immunology, aspects of this virus's life cycle remain incomplete. For example, while viral entry has been shown to depend on a cell adhesion molecule, DAG1, genetic knockout of this gene allows for residual viral infection, implying that additional receptors can mediate cell entry. The significance of our study is the identification of host factors important for successful infection, including the sialomucin CD164, which had not been previously associated with viral infection. We demonstrated that CD164 is essential for LCMV entry into human cells and can serve as a possible therapeutic target for treatment of congenital infection.

This complexity underlies the incomplete understanding of the genetic architecture of congenital heart diseases (CHDs). To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of cardiac cellular development, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of human fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each associated with dynamic transcription factor (TF) activity signatures. We identified similarities and differences of regulatory landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and their in vivo counterparts. We interpreted deep learning models that predict cell-type resolved, base-resolution chromatin accessibility profiles from DNA sequence to decipher underlying TF motif lexicons and infer the regulatory impact of non-coding variants. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched in CHD cases versus controls. We used CRISPR-based perturbations to validate an enhancer harboring a nominated regulatory CHD mutation, linking it to effects on the expression of a known CHD gene JARID2. Together, this work defines the cell-type resolved cis-regulatory sequence determinants of heart development and identifies disruption of cell type-specific regulatory elements as a component of the genetic etiology of CHD.",,10.1101/2022.06.29.498132,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.498132v1,2022.06.29.498132,6/29/2022,,,"Department of Cancer Biology, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Physics, Stanford University; Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Stanford University; Center for Stem Cell and Organoid Medicine, CuSTOM, Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center; Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford University; Department of Computer science, California Institute of Technology; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Illumina Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Illumina Inc; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford University; Department of Cancer Biology, Stanford University; Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Genetics, Stanford University; Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University; Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Department of Genetics, Stanford University",,,0,,

Yet the microbial functions that underpin succession are not well described. Further, how previous precipitation regimes frame microbial functional capacities after rewetting and the length of time that these effects persist remain unknown. To address these questions, we performed rewetting of seasonally dry grassland soil that experienced either mean annual or reduced precipitation during the growing season using isotopically labeled water, and sampled at five time points. We used quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP)-informed genome-resolved metagenomics to identify actively growing bacteria and archaea, to predict their traits and analyze how these traits differ over time and between precipitation treatments.Results We reconstructed 503 genomes representing bacteria and archaea from 11 phyla and 23 classes, of which 77 were from active organisms (15% of organisms). Actively growing organisms at any time point and in any treatment were primarily Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Growing organisms were significantly more abundant than non-growing organisms prior to the wet-up, suggesting that the traits that initiate succession are pre-defined at the end of the growing season or by survival over the dry season. Fast growing organisms had a relatively low number of carbohydrate active enzymes per genome compared to slower growing organisms. This suggests that although they are capable of degrading complex C sources such as plant material, they do not specialize in this process. Differential abundance of carbohydrate active enzymes in growing organisms throughout the succession implies variation in substrates over time. However, nitrogen cycling pathways differed between precipitation treatments, but in growing organisms there was no change in the abundance of genes involved over time following wetup. Comparison of gene inventories prior to wet-up revealed that many genes were significantly differentially abundant between the precipitation treatments. Surprisingly, this legacy effect waned after just one week, indicating that microbial community functions likely converge early in the growing season.Conclusions Use of isotopic labeling of genomes of soil microorganisms during the first week after wetup revealed differences in the abundance and functional traits of actively growing organisms under two precipitation regimes. Although the legacy effect due to different rainfall inputs was short lived, it is important, given the extent of soil organic matter breakdown that occurs immediately after the first rain event in Mediterranean climates. Changes in the potential to degrade complex organic matter during the succession imply that the current paradigm that succession relies solely on labile carbon sources needs to be revisited.",,10.1101/2022.06.28.498032,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.28.498032v1,2022.06.28.498032,6/29/2022,,,"University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; University of California Berkeley, Department of plant and microbial biology; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore; Life & Environmental Sciences Department, University of California Merced; Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore; University of California Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management; Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco",,,0,,

Unfortunately, these biosensors often suffer from cross-reactivity problems when measuring a target in samples containing other chemically similar molecules, such as precursors or metabolites. While some progress has been made in selecting highly specific aptamers, the discovery of these reagents remains slow and costly. In this work, we demonstrate a novel strategy to distinguish molecules with miniscule difference in chemical composition (such as a single hydroxyl group) – with cross reactive aptamer probes - by tuning the charge state of the surface on which the aptamer probes are immobilized. As an exemplar, we show that our strategy can distinguish between DOX and many structurally similar analytes, including its primary metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol). We then demonstrate the ability to accurately quantify mixtures of these two molecules based on their differential response to sensors with different surface-charge properties.

Whether ferroptosis sensitivity is governed by a single regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, based on the integration of 24 published chemical genetic screens combined with targeted follow-up experimentation, we find that the genetic regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity is highly variable and context-dependent. For example, the lipid metabolic gene acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) appears far more essential for ferroptosis triggered by direct inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) than by cystine deprivation. Despite this, distinct pro-ferroptotic stimuli converge upon a common lethal effector mechanism: accumulation of lipid peroxides at the plasma membrane. These results indicate that distinct genetic mechanisms regulate ferroptosis sensitivity, with implications for the initiation and analysis of this process in vivo.

We therefore assessed rural-urban differences in diabetes care and control in LMICs.              Research design and methods:                    We pooled individual-level data from nationally representative health surveys in 42 countries. We used Poisson regression models to estimate age-adjusted differences in the proportion of individuals with diabetes in rural versus urban areas achieving performance measures for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risk factors. We examined differences across the pooled sample, by sex, and by country.              Results:                    The pooled sample from 42 countries included 840,110 individuals (35,404 with diabetes).

A key component to this is that global transcription rates increase in larger cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we identify RNAPII as the major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size in budding yeast as transcription is highly sensitive to the dosage of RNAPII but not to other components of the general transcriptional machinery. Our experiments support a dynamic equilibrium model where global transcription at a given size is set by the mass-action recruitment kinetics of unengaged nucleoplasmic RNAPII, and DNA content. This drives a sub-linear increase in transcription with size, which is precisely compensated for by a decrease in mRNA decay rates as cells enlarge.

Some of the most frequently activated oncogenes driving diverse cancers are c-MYC, EGFR, HER2, AKT, KRAS, BRAF, and MEK. Using a reductionist approach, we explored how cellular proteomes are remodeled in isogenic cell lines engineered with or without these driver oncogenes. The most striking discovery for all oncogenic models was the systematic downregulation of scores of antiviral proteins regulated by type 1 interferon. These findings extended to cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models of highly refractory pancreatic cancer and osteosarcoma driven by KRAS and MYC oncogenes. The oncogenes reduced basal expression of and autocrine stimulation by type 1 interferon causing remarkable convergence on common phenotypic and functional profiles. In particular, there was dramatically lower expression of dsRNA sensors including DDX58 (RIG-I) and OAS proteins, which resulted in attenuated functional responses when the oncogenic cells were treated with the dsRNA mimetic, polyI:C, and increased susceptibility to infection with an RNA virus shown using SARS-CoV-2.

Following damage, Drosophila imaginal discs, the larval precursors of adult structures, can regenerate missing portions by localized proliferation of damage-adjacent tissue. Using single-cell transcriptomics in regenerating wing discs, we have obtained a comprehensive view of the transcriptome of regenerating discs and identified two regeneration-specific cell populations within the blastema, Blastema1 and Blastema2. Collectively, these cells upregulate multiple genes encoding secreted proteins that promote regeneration including Pvf1, upd3, asperous, Mmp1, and the maturation delaying factor Ilp8. Expression of the transcription factor Ets21C is restricted to this regenerative secretory zone; it is not expressed in undamaged discs. Ets21C expression is activated by the JNK/AP-1 pathway, and it can function in a type 1 coherent feedforward loop with AP-1 to sustain expression of downstream genes. Without Ets21C function, the blastema cells fail to maintain the expression of a number of genes, which leads to premature differentiation and severely compromised regeneration. As Ets21C is dispensable for normal development, these observations indicate that Ets21C orchestrates a regeneration-specific gene regulatory network. We have also identified cells resembling both Blastema1 and Blastema2 in scribble tumorous discs. They express the Ets21C-dependent gene regulatory network, and eliminating Ets21C function reduces tumorous growth. Thus, mechanisms that function during regeneration can be co-opted by tumors to promote aberrant growth.

Yet, the long-term survival of these patients remains limited, because treatment responses are typically incomplete. One potential explanation for the lack of complete and durable responses is that oncogene-driven cancers with activating mutations of EGFR often harbor additional co-occurring genetic alterations. This hypothesis remains untested for most genetic alterations that co-occur with mutant EGFR. Here, we report the functional impact of inactivating genetic alterations of the mRNA splicing factor RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) that co-occur with mutant EGFR. RBM10 deficiency decreased EGFR inhibitor efficacy in patient-derived EGFR-mutant tumor models. RBM10 modulated mRNA alternative splicing of the mitochondrial apoptotic regulator Bcl-x to regulate tumor cell apoptosis during treatment. Genetic inactivation of RBM10 diminished EGFR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of (proapoptotic) Bcl-xS to (antiapoptotic) Bcl-xL isoforms of Bcl-x. RBM10 deficiency was a biomarker of poor response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in clinical samples. Coinhibition of Bcl-xL and mutant EGFR overcame the resistance induced by RBM10 deficiency.

Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment.

Results:                    Actigraphy and RNA sequencing data was evaluated on 35 patients. The cohort mean age was 56±12 years, 91% female, 31% white, 9% African American, 9% Asian, 40% Hispanic. We found 767 genes differentially expressed (padj<0.1) between patients in the greatest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, after adjusting for sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The most active patients exhibited dose-dependent downregulation of several immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis. These included CD40, STAT3, TREM-1, IL-17a, IL-8, toll-like receptor and interferon signaling pathways. Upstream cytokine activation state analysis predicted reduced activation of TNF-alpha and interferon in the most active group. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for RA disease activity and physical function and found consistent results.              Conclusion:                    RA patients who were more physically active had lower expression of immune signaling pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, even after adjusting for disease activity, suggesting that physical activity may confer a protective effect in RA.",35777820,10.3899/jrheum.220050.,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.220050,,,7/1/2022,,,,2022 Jul 1;jrheum.220050.,0,,

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physicochemical data and 16S rRNA gene amplicons to characterize the sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 30% of those currently known, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. 16S rRNA gene amplicon screening of 224 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs retrieved from a single site are representative of the microbial community in the vent field sediments. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison between Auka MAGs and MAGs from Guaymas Basin revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap, suggestive of long-distance species transfer over 400 km and subsequent sediment colonization. Optimal growth temperature prediction on the Auka MAGs, and thousands of reference genomes, shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently.

Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.",35584773,10.1038/s41586-022-04865-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9279157/,,5/18/2022,Jul-22,,,,2022 Jul;607(7918):351-355.,0,,

Pollard",biorxiv,Pitfalls of genotyping microbial communities with rapidly growing genome collections,"SUMMARYDetecting genetic variants in metagenomic data is a priority for understanding the evolution, ecology, and functional characteristics of microbial communities. Many recent tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a reference database of sequences from many species before calling variants. Using simulations designed to represent a wide range of scenarios, we demonstrate that diverse and closely related species both reduce the power and accuracy of reference-based metagenotyping. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a tradeoff between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we quantitatively evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods with promise to further improve metagenotyping. These findings document a critical challenge that has come to light through the rapid growth of genome collections that push the limits of current alignment algorithms. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.HIGHLIGHTSMost microbial species are genetically diverse. Their single nucleotide variants can be genotyped using metagenomic data aligned to databases constructed from genome collections (“metagenotyping”).Microbial genome collections have grown and now contain many pairs of closely related species.Closely related species produce high-scoring but incorrect alignments while also reducing the uniqueness of correct alignments. Both cause metagenotype errors.This dilemma can be mitigated by leveraging paired-end reads, customizing databases to species detected in the sample, and adjusting post-alignment filters.",,10.1101/2022.06.30.498336,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.30.498336v1,2022.06.30.498336,7/2/2022,,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California",,,0,,

We hypothesized that phyllosphere interactions may be disrupted in a greenhouse setting, where microbial dispersal is limited, and that adding a microbial amendment might yield important benefits to the host plant.Using a newly developed synthetic phyllosphere microbiome for Tomato, we tested this hypothesis across multiple trials by manipulating microbial colonization of leaves and measuring subsequent plant growth and reproductive success, comparing results from plants grown in both greenhouse and field settings.We confirmed that greenhouse-grown plants have a depauperate phyllosphere microbiome and that the addition of the synthetic microbial community was responsible for a clear and repeatable increase in fruit production in this setting. We further show that this effect is synergistic with the addition of micronutrient-based soil amendments, with important implications for agriculture.These results suggest that greenhouse environments have poor phyllosphere microbiome establishment, with negative impacts on the plant.

Yet, despite decades of work, we lack quantitative models that can predict how transcriptional control emerges from molecular interactions at the gene locus. Thermodynamic models of transcription, which assume that gene circuits operate at equilibrium, have previously been employed with considerable success in the context of bacterial systems. However, the presence of ATP-dependent processes within the eukaryotic transcriptional cycle suggests that equilibrium models may be insufficient to capture how eukaryotic gene circuits sense and respond to input transcription factor concentrations. Here, we employ simple kinetic models of transcription to investigate how energy dissipation within the transcriptional cycle impacts the rate at which genes transmit information and drive cellular decisions. We find that biologically plausible levels of energy input can lead to significant gains in how rapidly gene loci transmit information, but discover that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gains change depending on the level of interference from non-cognate activator binding. When interference is low, information is maximized by harnessing energy to push the sensitivity of the transcriptional response to input transcription factors beyond its equilibrium limits. Conversely, when interference is high, conditions favor genes that harness energy to increase transcriptional specificity by proofreading activator identity. Our analysis further reveals that equilibrium gene regulatory mechanisms break down as transcriptional interference increases, suggesting that energy dissipation may be indispensable in systems where non-cognate factor interference is sufficiently large.",,10.1101/2022.07.01.498451,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498451v1,2022.07.01.498451,7/3/2022,,,"Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Physics Department, California Institute of Technology; Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley; Institute for Quantitative Biosciences-QB3, University of California at Berkeley; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 14 weeks and do not assess study parameters in male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences. Furthermore, the molecular setup of tissues in dependence of age and sex is unknown in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) – two tissues, which are crucially implicated in nociception and pain as well as diverse diseases induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing (i) male and female mice, and, in parallel, (ii) adolescent mice (4 weeks) with adult mice (14 weeks). Age was identified as a major discriminator of analyzed samples irrespective of tissue type. Moreover, our analysis enabled us to decipher protein subsets and networks that exhibit differential abundance in dependence on the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins and signaling pathways with known relevance for (patho)physiology, such as homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. In addition, extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that we quantified approx. 50% of gene products that were implicated in distinct skin diseases and pain, many of which exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study emphasizes the need for accurate age matching and uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique systems biology proteome resource, which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology in dependence on age and sex - a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.Download figureOpen in new tabGraphic workflowThe Figure was partly generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license.",,10.1101/2022.07.04.498721,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498721v1,2022.07.04.498721,7/4/2022,,,"Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Systems Biology of Pain, Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",,,0,,

We identified the co-occurring proteins that distinguish the major lineages. Those with metabolic roles were consistent with experimental data. However, two families specific to Asgard were determined to be new eukaryotic signature proteins. Overall, the blocks of lineage-specific families are dominated by proteins that lack functional predictions.              Conclusions:                    Given that these hypothetical proteins are near ubiquitous within major archaeal groups, we propose that they were important in the origin of most of the major archaeal lineages.

ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1.

Pollard",biorxiv,Maast: genotyping thousands of microbial strains efficiently,"Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of intraspecific genomes is a prerequisite to performing population genetic analysis and microbial epidemiology. However, existing algorithms fail to scale for species with thousands of sequenced strains, nor do they account for the biased sampling of strains that has produced considerable redundancy in genome databases. Here we present Maast, a tool that reduces the computational burden of SNP genotyping by leveraging this genomic redundancy. Maast implements a novel algorithm to dynamically identify a minimum set of phylogenetically diverse conspecific genomes that contains the maximum number of SNPs above a user-specified allele frequency. Then it uses these genomes to construct a SNP panel for each species. A species’ SNP panel enables Maast to rapidly genotype thousands of strains using a hybrid of whole-genome alignment and k-mer exact matching. Maast works with both genome assemblies and unassembled sequencing reads. Compared to existing genotyping methods, Maast is more accurate and up to two orders of magnitude faster.

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population. Comorbid lung disease and lower levels of initial IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen were associated with longer symptom duration.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04373148.FUNDINGNIH UL1TR003142 CTSA grant, NIH U54CA260517 grant, NIEHS R21 ES03304901, Sean N Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sunshine Foundation, Crown Foundation, and Parker Foundation.

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response may contribute to this disparity, we compare nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 older adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes is robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrate markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including response to TNF and production of IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4. Cell type deconvolution confirms greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibit a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, among the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and especially adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.",35803954,10.1038/s41467-022-31600-0.,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc9263813/,,,7/8/2022,,,,2022 Jul 8;13(1):3937.,0,,

However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs.

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of T cell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally, Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity.

These strain-level dynamics are challenging to understand because they depend on complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in simulated fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that over longer timescales, the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth alone are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective generation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for quantifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a recently established method for culture-independent LRTI diagnosis, but its utility for predicting AMR has remained unclear. We aimed to assess the performance of mNGS for AMR prediction in bacterial LRTI and demonstrate proof of concept for epidemiological AMR surveillance and rapid AMR gene detection using Cas9 enrichment and nanopore sequencing.              Methods:                    We studied 88 patients with acute respiratory failure between 07/2013 and 9/2018, enrolled through a previous observational study of LRTI. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18, need for mechanical ventilation, and respiratory specimen collection within 72 h of intubation. Exclusion criteria were decline of study participation, unclear LRTI status, or no matched RNA and DNA mNGS data from a respiratory specimen. Patients with LRTI were identified by clinical adjudication. mNGS was performed on lower respiratory tract specimens. The primary outcome was mNGS performance for predicting phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and was assessed in patients with LRTI from culture-confirmed bacterial pathogens with clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing (n = 27 patients, n = 32 pathogens). Secondary outcomes included the association between hospital exposure and AMR gene burden in the respiratory microbiome (n = 88 patients), and AMR gene detection using Cas9 targeted enrichment and nanopore sequencing (n = 10 patients).              Results:                    Compared to clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the performance of respiratory mNGS for predicting AMR varied by pathogen, antimicrobial, and nucleic acid type sequenced. For gram-positive bacteria, a combination of RNA + DNA mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47-87%) and specificity of 95% (CI 85-99%). For gram-negative bacteria, sensitivity was 100% (CI 87-100%) and specificity 64% (CI 48-78%). Patients with hospital-onset LRTI had a greater AMR gene burden in their respiratory microbiome versus those with community-onset LRTI (p = 0.00030), or those without LRTI (p = 0.0024). We found that Cas9 targeted sequencing could enrich for low abundance AMR genes by > 2500-fold and enabled their rapid detection using a nanopore platform.

We analyzed immune cells and phosphorylated signaling states at single-cell resolution from longitudinal blood samples of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, pneumonia and/or sepsis, and healthy individuals by mass cytometry. COVID-19 patients showed distinct immune compositions and an early, coordinated, and elevated immune cell signaling profile associated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient longitudinal analysis revealed changes in myeloid and T cell frequencies and a reduction in immune cell signaling across cell types that accompanied disease resolution and discharge. These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To date, capturing how these structures interact during invasion has been difficult to observe in detail. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to image the apical complex of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites under conditions that mimic resting parasites and those primed to invade through stimulation with calcium ionophore. Through the application of Mixed Scale Dense networks for image-processing, we developed a highly efficient pipeline for annotation of tomograms, enabling us to identify and extract densities of relevant subcellular organelles and accurately analyze features in 3D. The results reveal a dramatic change in the shape of the anteriorly located apical vesicle upon its apparent fusion with a rhoptry, that occurs only in the stimulated parasites. We also present information indicating that this vesicle originates from the vesicles that parallel the intraconoidal microtubules and that the latter two structures are linked by a novel tether. We show that a rosette structure previously proposed to be involved in rhoptry secretion is associated with apical vesicles beyond just the most anterior one. This result, suggesting multiple vesicles are primed to enable rhoptry secretion, may shed light on the mechanisms Toxoplasma employs to enable repeated invasion attempts. Using the same approach, we examine Plasmodium falciparum merozoites and show that they too possess an apical vesicle just beneath a rosette, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of this overall subcellular organization.Significance Statement Parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for some of the most important parasitic diseases of humans, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Invasion by these obligatory, intracellular parasites depends on protein injection into the host cell. Using cryogenic electron tomography, we reveal evolutionarily conserved features shared by the invasive forms of Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. By comparing resting Toxoplasma tachyzoites with those primed to invade we also gain new insight into the very first steps in invasion. For this work, we take an interdisciplinary approach, adopting a mixed-scale dense neural network that enables efficient and objective processing of the data.

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.16.500284v1,2022.07.16.500284,7/16/2022,,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

Cate",biorxiv,Rare Ribosomal RNA Sequences from Archaea Stabilize the Bacterial Ribosome,"Ribosomes serve as the universally conserved translators of the genetic code into proteins and must support life across temperatures ranging from below freezing to above the boiling point of water. Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Peptide bond formation by the ribosome requires correct positioning of the 3’s-end of the aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrate, which is aided by an RNA hairpin in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit, termed the A loop. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3′-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not exert a dominant negative effect on cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation in the peptidyl transferase center of the archaeal ribosome that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.499945v1,2022.07.15.499945,7/16/2022,,,"Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California; Environmental Science, University of California; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory",,,0,,

Here, we carried out integrated host and pathogen metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) of whole blood (n=221) and plasma RNA and DNA (n=138) from critically ill patients following hospital admission. We assigned patients into sepsis groups based on clinical and microbiological criteria: 1) sepsis with bloodstream infection (SepsisBSI), 2) sepsis with peripheral site infection but not bloodstream infection (Sepsisnon-BSI), 3) suspected sepsis with negative clinical microbiological testing; 4) no evidence of infection (No-Sepsis), and 5) indeterminant sepsis status. From whole blood gene expression data, we first trained a bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier to distinguish SepsisBSI and Sepsisnon-BSI patients from No-Sepsis patients, using 75% of the cohort. This classifier performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 in the training set (75% of cohort) and an AUC of 0.82 in a held-out validation set (25% of cohort). Surprisingly, we found that plasma RNA also yielded a biologically relevant transcriptional signature of sepsis which included several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers (e.g., HLA-DRA, CD-177). A bSVM classifier for sepsis diagnosis trained on RNA gene expression data performed with an AUC of 0.97 in the training set and an AUC of 0.77 in a held-out validation set. We subsequently assessed the pathogen-detection performance of DNA and RNA mNGS by comparing against a practical reference standard of clinical bacterial culture and respiratory viral PCR. We found that sensitivity varied based on site of infection and pathogen, with an overall sensitivity of 83%, and a per-pathogen sensitivity of 100% for several key sepsis pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria were also identified in 10/37 (27%) of patients in the No-Sepsis group. To improve detection of sepsis due to viral infections, we developed a secondary RNA host transcriptomic classifier which performed with an AUC of 0.94 in the training set and an AUC of 0.96 in the validation set. Finally, we combined host and microbial features to develop a proof-of-concept integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 72/73 (99%) of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 14/19 (74%) of suspected, and 8/9 (89%) of indeterminate sepsis cases.

This flux underpins an organ's ability to homeostatically renew, to non-homeostatically resize upon altered functional demand, and to return to homeostasis after resizing or injury-in other words, to be dynamic. Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.

Here, we describe a low-cost, semi-automated pipeline to extract cell-free RNA (cfRNA) that like many RNA isolation protocols, can be decomposed into three subparts – RNA extraction, DNA digestion, and RNA cleaning and concentration. RT-qPCR data using a synthetic spike-in confirms comparable RNA quality as compared to manual sample processing, the gold-standard used in our prior work. The semi-automated pipeline also shows striking improvement in sample throughput (+12x), time spent (−11x), cost (−3x), and biohazardous waste produced (−4x) as compared to its manual counterpart. In total, this protocol enables cfRNA extraction from 96 samples simultaneously in 4.5 hours; in practice, this dramatically improves time to results as demonstrated in our recent work [1] where it was used to process 404 samples in 27 hours. Importantly, any lab already has most of the parts required (manual pipette, corresponding tips and kits) to build a semi-automated sample processing pipeline of their own and would only need to purchase or 3D-print a few extra parts ($5.5K total).

Ca2+ dynamics have been studied widely in cellular monocultures, yet organs in vivo comprise heterogeneous populations of stem and differentiated cells. Here, we examine Ca2+ dynamics in the adult Drosophila intestine, a self-renewing epithelial organ in which stem cells continuously produce daughters that differentiate into either enteroendocrine cells or enterocytes. Live imaging of whole organs ex vivo reveals that stem-cell daughters adopt strikingly distinct patterns of Ca2+ oscillations after differentiation: enteroendocrine cells exhibit single-cell Ca2+ oscillations, whereas enterocytes exhibit rhythmic, long-range Ca2+ waves. These multicellular waves do not propagate through immature progenitors (stem cells and enteroblasts), of which the oscillation frequency is approximately half that of enteroendocrine cells. Organ-scale inhibition of gap junctions eliminates Ca2+ oscillations in all cell types - even, intriguingly, in progenitor and enteroendocrine cells that are surrounded only by enterocytes. Our findings establish that cells adopt fate-specific modes of Ca2+ dynamics as they terminally differentiate and reveal that the oscillatory dynamics of different cell types in a single, coherent epithelium are paced independently.

While the cyclical processes of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration characterizing their life cycle have been documented previously, the cellular and molecular changes associated with such processes and their relationship with variation in brain morphology and individual (zooid) behavior throughout adult life remains unknown. Here, we introduce Botryllus schlosseri as an invertebrate model for neurogenesis, neural degeneration, and evolutionary neuroscience. Our analysis reveals that during the weekly colony budding (i.e., asexual reproduction), prior to programmed cell death and removal by phagocytes, decreases in the number of neurons in the adult brain are associated with reduced behavioral response and significant change in the expression of 73 mammalian homologous genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Similarly, when comparing young colonies (1 to 2 y of age) to those reared in a laboratory for ∼20 y, we found that older colonies contained significantly fewer neurons and exhibited reduced behavioral response alongside changes in the expression of 148 such genes (35 of which were differentially expressed across both timescales).

Recent work has shown that these lakes can also harbor numerous bacteria and archaea from novel lineages, including those from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). However, the extent to which geochemical stratification differentially impacts carbon metabolism and overall genetic potential in CPR bacteria compared to other organisms is not well defined. Here, we determine the distribution of microbial lineages along an oxygen gradient in Lac Pavin, a deep, stratified lake in central France, and examine the influence of this gradient on their metabolism. Genome-based analyses revealed an enrichment of distinct C1 and CO2 fixation pathways in the oxic lake interface and anoxic zone/sediments, suggesting that oxygen likely plays a role in structuring metabolic strategies in non-CPR bacteria and archaea. Notably, we find that oxidation of methane and its byproducts is largely spatially separated from methane production, which is mediated by diverse communities of sediment methanogens that vary on the centimeter scale. In contrast, we detected evidence for RuBisCO throughout the water column and sediments, including form II/III and form III-related enzymes encoded by CPR bacteria in the water column and DPANN archaea in the sediments. Overall, CPR bacteria and phages did not show strong signals of gene content differentiation by depth, despite the fact that distinct species groups populate different lake and sediment compartments.

Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting.

We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

Nayak",biorxiv,The dual role of a multi-heme cytochrome in methanogenesis: MmcA is important for energy conservation and carbon metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans,"Methanogenic archaea belonging to the Order Methanosarcinales conserve energy using an electron transport chain (ETC). In the genetically tractable strain Methanosarcina acetivorans, ferredoxin donates electrons to the ETC via the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) complex. The Rnf complex in M. acetivorans, unlike its counterpart in Bacteria, contains a multiheme c-type cytochrome (MHC) subunit called MmcA. Early studies hypothesized MmcA is a critical component of Rnf, however recent work posits that the primary role of MmcA is facilitating extracellular electron transport. To explore the physiological role of MmcA, we characterized M. acetivorans mutants lacking either the entire Rnf complex (Δrnf) or just the MmcA subunit (ΔmmcA). Our data show that MmcA is essential for growth during acetoclastic methanogenesis but neither Rnf nor MmcA are required for methanogenic growth on methylated compounds. On methylated compounds, the absence of MmcA alone leads to a more severe growth defect compared to a Rnf deletion likely due to different strategies for ferredoxin regeneration that arise in each strain. Transcriptomic data suggest that the ΔmmcA mutant might regenerate ferredoxin by upregulating the cytosolic Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis, whereas the Δrnf mutant may repurpose the F420 dehydrogenase complex (Fpo) to regenerate ferredoxin coupled to proton translocation. Beyond energy conservation, the deletion of Rnf or MmcA leads to some shared and some unique transcriptional changes in methyltransferase genes and regulatory proteins. Overall, our study provides systems-level insights into the non-overlapping roles of the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated MHC, MmcA.Importance Methane is a greenhouse gas that is ten times more potent than carbon dioxide and efforts to curb emissions are crucial to meet climate goals. Methane emissions primarily stem from the metabolic activity of microorganisms called methanogenic archaea (methanogens). The electron transport chain (ETC) in methanogens that belong to the Order Methanosarcinales has been the focus of many in vitro studies to date, but the endogenous functions of the bioenergetic complexes that comprise the ETC have rarely been investigated. In this study, we use genetic techniques to functionally characterize the Rnf bioenergetic complex and the associated multi-heme c-type cytochrome MmcA in the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans. Our results show that MmcA and Rnf have shared and unique roles in the cell, and that, contrary to current knowledge, M. acetivorans has the capacity to induce at least two alternative pathways for ferredoxin regeneration in the absence of a functional Rnf complex.",,10.1101/2022.07.20.500911,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500911v1,2022.07.20.500911,7/21/2022,,,"Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California",,,0,,

One of the most notable such features is nucleosomal chromatin, although archaeal histones and chromatin differ significantly from those of eukaryotes. Despite increased interest in archaeal histones in recent years, the properties of archaeal chromatin have been little studied using genomic tools. Here, we adapt the ATAC-seq assay to archaea and use it to map the accessible landscape of the genome of the euryarchaeote Haloferax volcanii. We integrate the resulting datasets with genome-wide maps of active transcription and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and find that while H. volcanii promoters exist in a preferentially accessible state, modulation of transcriptional activity is not associated with changes in promoter accessibility, unlike the typical situation in eukaryotes. Applying orthogonal single-molecule footprinting methods, we quantify the absolute levels of physical protection of H. volcanii, and find that archaeal nucleosomal chromatin is similarly or only slightly more accessible, in aggregate, than that of eukaryotes. We also evaluate the degree of coordination of transcription within archaeal operons and make the unexpected observation that some CRISPR arrays are associated with highly prevalent ssDNA structures.

The ICHIRF-BRAIN Study","Mild traumatic brain injury is widely regarded as a misnomer: it is globally a major cause of disability and is hypothesized as a potential causal factor in subsequent neurodegeneration. Commonly arising in sport, mounting evidence of varying degrees of cognitive impairment in retired athletes exposed to repeated concussions motivates close examination of its cumulative effects on the brain. Studying a cohort of 125 retired athletes with a mean of 11 reported concussions and 36 matched controls with none, here we evaluated whole-brain volumetric and subcortical morphological effects with Bayesian regression models and functional connectivity effects with network-based statistics. Estimates of potential cognitive impact were derived from meta-analytic functional mapping based on 13,459 imaging studies. Across the array of brain structural and functional effects identified, regions significantly lower in volume in the concussed group included, in order of greatest effect size, the middle frontal gyrus, hippocampus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, brain regions significantly larger within the athlete group included, in order of greatest effect size, the hippocampal and collateral sulcus, middle occipital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbital gyrus, and medial segment to the postcentral gyrus (all significant with 95% Bayesian credible interval). Subcortical morphology analysis corroborated these findings, revealing a significant, age-independent relationship between inward deformation of the hippocampus and the number of concussions sustained (corrected- p<0.0001). Functional connectivity analyses revealed a distinct brain network with significantly increased edge strength in the athlete cohort comprising 150 nodes and 400 edges (corrected-p=0.02), with the highest degree nodes including the pre-central and post-central gyri and right insula. The functional communities of the greatest eigenvector centralities corresponded to motor domains. Numerous edges of this network strengthened in athletes were significantly weakened with increasing bouts of concussion, which included disengagement of the frontal pole, superior frontal, and middle frontal gyri (p=0.04). Aligned to meta-analytic neuroimaging data, the observed changes suggest possible functional enhancement within the motor, sensory, coordination, balance, and visual processing domains in athletes, attenuated by concussive head injury with a negative impact on memory and language. That such changes are observed many years after retirement from impact sport suggests strong repetition effects and/or underpinning genetic selection factors.

Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the PROSITE database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites.

Yet, they can also act as a permissive niche for these pathogens to persist in infected tissues within granulomas, which are immunological structures comprised of macrophages and other immune cells. We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using a STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is non-permissive for intracellular bacteria and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF preferentially depletes ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues. Thus ACE+ macrophages have differential capacity to serve as cellular niche for intracellular bacteria to establish persistent infection.Teaser This study shows that ACE+ granuloma macrophages have restricted capacity to act as a cellular niche that enables intracellular bacterial persistence.",,10.1101/2022.07.21.501041,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501041v1,2022.07.21.501041,7/22/2022,,,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine",,,0,,

To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48-hours for up to 10-weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, μCT, and histomorphometry. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7—corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap—then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.

Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the ΔCs but not ΔCh dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the ΔCsΔCh community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the ΔCh community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology.

However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4–6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways.

Here we present Scriabin – a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of CCC at single-cell resolution. We leverage multiple published datasets to show that Scriabin recovers expected CCC edges and use spatial transcriptomic data, genetic perturbation screens, and direct experimental manipulation of receptor-ligand interactions to validate that the recovered edges are biologically meaningful. We then apply Scriabin to uncover co-expressed programs of CCC from atlas-scale datasets, validating known communication pathways required for maintaining the intestinal stem cell niche and revealing species-specific communication pathways. Finally, we utilize single-cell communication networks calculated using Scriabin to follow communication pathways that operate between timepoints in longitudinal datasets, highlighting bystander cells as important initiators of inflammatory reactions in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof of principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small-molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells.

Two are predicted homologs of the human protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a key enzyme that regulates insulin signaling.

Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Disruption of both mTOR complexes leads to pronounced deficits in dopamine release demonstrating the importance of balanced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling for dopaminergic function.

In response, cells mount complex responses across multiple scales, including adjusting their shape to withstand stress.

Here, we investigated the physiological and morphological consequences of Rcs activation in Escherichia coli in the absence of stresses, using an inducible version of RcsF that mislocalizes to the inner membrane, RcsFIM. Expression of RcsFIM immediately reduced cellular growth rate and the added length per cell cycle in a manner that was directly dependent on induction levels, but independent of Rcs-induced capsule production. At the same time, cells increased intracellular concentration of the cell division protein FtsZ, and decreased the distance between division rings in filamentous cells. Depletion of the Rcs negative regulator IgaA phenocopied RcsFIM induction, indicating that IgaA is essential due to growth inhibition in its absence. However, A22 treatment did not affect growth rate or FtsZ intracellular concentration, despite activating the Rcs system. These findings suggest that the effect of Rcs activation on FtsZ levels is mediated indirectly through growth-rate changes, and highlight feedbacks among the Rcs stress response, growth dynamics, and cell-size control.",,10.1101/2022.07.26.501648,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501648v1,2022.07.26.501648,7/27/2022,,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Collaboration for joint PhD degree between EMBL and Heidelberg University, Faculty of Biosciences; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics, and Computer Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Biology, California Institute of Technology; Genome Biology Unit, EMBL Heidelberg; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

To test whether cell size changes might be correlated with envelope damage and thereby sensed by the Rcs system, we tuned E. coli cell size via drug inhibition with A22, point mutations to the cell-shape determinant MreB, and mechanically confined growth. In all conditions, cell width was strongly correlated with Rcs activation, with wider cells exhibiting more activation than wild-type. In all conditions, RcsF, the outer membrane-localized upstream component of the Rcs system, was essential for responding to cell width changes. Consistently, several envelope gene deletions known to induce the Rcs system via RcsF resulted in cells that were wider than wild-type. Cryo- electron microscopy revealed that the periplasm of a wide MreB mutant was on average ∼3 nm thinner than wild-type, thereby bringing RcsF closer to the downstream components of the signaling cascade in the inner membrane. Conversely, extending the flexible linker region of RcsF by ∼3 nm increased Rcs activity in wild-type cells.

However, applying it to GPCRs without signaling proteins remains challenging because most receptors lack structural features in their soluble domains to facilitate image alignment. In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although a similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear.

Recently, several papers have called into question the performance of lattice light sheets relative to the Gaussian sheets most common in light sheet microscopy. Here we undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of various forms of light sheet microscopy which both demonstrates and explains why lattice light sheets provide significant improvements in resolution and photobleaching reduction. The analysis provides a procedure to select the correct light sheet for a desired experiment and specifies the processing that maximizes the use of all fluorescence generated within the light sheet excitation envelope for optimal resolution while minimizing image artifacts and photodamage. Development of a new type of “harmonic balanced” lattice light sheet is shown to improve performance at all spatial frequencies within its 3D resolution limits and maintains this performance over lengthened propagation distances allowing for expanded fields of view.Significance Statement Despite its rapidly growing use, several misconceptions remain concerning the physics of image formation and its optimization in light sheet microscopy, particularly in high resolution variants tailored for subcellular imaging. These include the role of excitation sidelobes, the significance of out-of-focus fluorescence, the importance and optimization of deconvolution, and the perceived advantages of Gaussian beams. Here we attempt to shatter these misconceptions by showing that the professed tradeoffs between axial resolution and background haze, photobleaching rate, phototoxicity, and propensity for image artifacts do not exist for well-crafted lattice light sheets whose data is acquired and processed rigorously. The framework we provide should enable others to optimize light sheets and extract the most information at the lowest cost in their experiments.",,10.1101/2022.07.30.502108,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.30.502108v1,2022.07.30.502108,7/30/2022,,,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus; Department of Physics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,0,,

We conducted a population size-weighted, one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of health insurance coverage, using a population-based sample of 2,035,401 participants ages 15-59 from nationally representative household surveys in fifty-six countries during the period 2006-18. One in five people (20.3 percent) across the fifty-six countries in our study had health insurance. Health insurance coverage exceeded 50 percent in only seven countries and 70 percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4 percent versus 28.6 percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege.

Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.              Methods:                    Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.              Results:                    Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.              Interpretation:                    Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.

Although numerous secreted effector proteins that reprogram innate immunity to promote virulence have been identified in pathogenic bacteria, so far, there are no examples of analogous secreted effector proteins produced by human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans, the most common cause of fungal meningitis and a major pathogen in AIDS, induces a pathogenic type 2 response characterized by pulmonary eosinophilia and alternatively activated macrophages3-8. Here, we identify CPL1 as an effector protein secreted by C. neoformans that drives alternative activation (also known as M2 polarization) of macrophages to enable pulmonary infection in mice. We observed that CPL1-enhanced macrophage polarization requires Toll-like receptor 4, which is best known as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin but is also a poorly understood mediator of allergen-induced type 2 responses9-12. We show that this effect is caused by CPL1 itself and not by contaminating lipopolysaccharide. CPL1 is essential for virulence, drives polarization of interstitial macrophages in vivo, and requires type 2 cytokine signalling for its effect on infectivity. Notably, C. neoformans associates selectively with polarized interstitial macrophages during infection, suggesting a mechanism by which C. neoformans generates its own intracellular replication niche within the host. This work identifies a circuit whereby a secreted effector protein produced by a human fungal pathogen reprograms innate immunity, revealing an unexpected role for Toll-like receptor 4 in promoting the pathogenesis of infectious disease.",35896747,10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4.,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05005-4,,7/27/2022,Aug-22,,,,2022 Aug;608(7921):161-167.,0,,

Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation.

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

Mouse cytomegalovirus infection triggers NK receptor-induced, ligand-specific IL-12-dependent NK cell expansion, yet specific IL-12 stimulation ex vivo leading to NK cell proliferation and expansion is not established. Here, we show that IL-12 alone can sustain human primary NK cell survival without providing IL-2 or IL-15 but was insufficient to promote human NK cell proliferation. IL-12 signaling analysis revealed STAT5 phosphorylation and weak mTOR activation, which was enhanced by activating NK receptor upregulation and crosslinking leading to STAT5-dependent, rapamycin-sensitive, or TGFβ-sensitive NK cell IL-12-dependent expansion, independently of IL-12 receptor upregulation. Prolonged IL-2 culture did not impair IL-12-dependent ligand-specific NK cell expansion. These findings demonstrate that activating NK receptor stimulation promotes differential IL-12 signaling, leading to human NK cell expansion, and suggest adopting strategies to provide IL-12 signaling in vivo for ligand-specific IL-2-primed NK cell-based therapies.",35758909,10.1084/jem.20212434.,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20212434,,6/27/2022,8/1/2022,,,,2022 Aug 1;219(8):e20212434.,0,,

ACE2-OE organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. NF-κB inhibitor alpha was consistently upregulated in infected epithelial cells, and its mRNA expression positively correlated with infection levels. Confocal microscopy showed more IκBα expression in infected than bystander cells, but found concurrent nuclear translocation of NF-κB that IκBα usually prevents. Overexpressing a nondegradable IκBα mutant reduced NF-κB translocation and increased viral infection.

Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property conferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in eight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly efficiency and cell entry compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization in sera from previously vaccinated subjects.

The current immune-modulatory therapies are unable to protect and repair immune-mediated neural tissue damage. One of the therapeutic targets in MS is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway which signals via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors 1-5 (S1P1-5). S1P receptors are expressed predominantly on immune and CNS cells. Considering the potential neuroprotective properties of S1P signaling, we utilized S1P1-GFP (Green fluorescent protein) reporter mice in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model to investigate in vivo S1P - S1P1 signaling in the CNS. We observed S1P1 signaling in a subset of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) during demyelination. During remyelination, S1P1 signaling is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the SVZ and mature oligodendrocytes in the medial corpus callosum (MCC). In the cuprizone model, we did not observe S1P1 signaling in neurons and astrocytes. We also observed β-arrestin-dependent S1P1 signaling in lymphocytes during demyelination and CNS inflammation.

Gene expression studies are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and few separate stromal and epithelial contributions, resulting in a lack of reliable prognostic biomarker to guide treatment decisions.Methods The gene expression of 293 microdissected regions from DCIS (92 epithelial, 31 stromal) and IDC (78 epithelial, 30 stromal) cases was aggregated from 6 datasets. Expression signatures of 6 cell lineages extracted from normal breast single-cell profiling were used to correct for differences in cell abundance. Subtype-specific functional differences between DCIS and IDC were measured for each region type using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). DCIS-IDC stromal-epithelial interactions were compared using the expression product of 139 ligand-receptor (LR) pairs permuting the DCIS-IDC labels to assess significance.Results Variation in cell-lineage abundance separated epithelial regions into 4 clusters, including one enriched for DCIS (Myoepi-Enriched) and two for IDC (Infiltrated, Vascularized). GSEA on cell lineage normalized expression data identified subtype-independent changes in epithelial regions (induction of Extracellular Matrix maintenance genes, reduction of Tp53 signaling in IDC), as well as subtype-specific changes (proliferation in ER- and Her2-IDC, reduction in Nucleotide Excision Repair in ER+ IDC). In the stroma, Notch and Rho-GTPase signaling were induced in IDC irrespective of subtype. The stromal-epithelial interaction level of 6 and 4 LR pairs were significantly enriched in DCIS and IDC, respectively. Five of the 6 DCIS-enriched LR pairs involved ephrin interactions, with interaction level progressively decreasing from normal to DCIS to IDC. In contrast, 2 IDC-enriched LR pairs involved T-cell activity likely regulating Treg proliferation (CD28-CD86) or T and NK cells stimulation (CD226-PVR).

Mechanistically, IF-induced hepatocyte proliferation is driven by the combined action of intestinally produced, systemic endocrine FGF15 and localized WNT signaling. Hepatocyte proliferation during periods of fasting and re-feeding re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio, thus maintaining the hepatostat.

Attempts have been made in the past to computationally predict which bacterial species and enzymes are responsible for chemical transformations in the gut environment, but with low accuracy due to minimal chemical representation and sequence similarity search schemes. Here, we present an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER). We show that SIMMER predicts the chemistry and responsible species and enzymes for a queried reaction with high accuracy, unlike previous methods. We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug transformations known to occur in the human gut. Bacterial species containing these enzymes are enriched within human donor stool samples that metabolize the query compound. After demonstrating its utility and accuracy, we chose to make SIMMER available as both a command-line and web tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical transformations within the human gut.

To evaluate the plausibility of reducing human sperm mitochondrial ATP production as an avenue for contraceptive development, we treated human sperm with small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing passive proton flow, and evaluated the effects on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for fertilization. We also sought to clarify the subcellular localization of Adenosine Nucleotide Translocator 4 (ANT4), a gamete-specific protein that has been suggested as a contraceptive target. We determined that ANT4 is mitochondrially localized, that induced mitochondrial uncoupling can be partially mediated by the ANT family, and that two uncouplers, Niclosamide Ethanolamine and BAM15, significantly decreased sperm progressive motility. However, these uncouplers did not reduce sperm ATP content or impair other physiological processes, implying that human sperm can rely on glycolysis for ATP production in the absence of functional mitochondria. Thus, since certain mitochondrial uncouplers impair motility through ATP-independent mechanisms, they could be useful ingredients in on-demand, vaginally-applied contraceptives. However, systemically delivered contraceptives that target sperm mitochondria to reduce their ATP production would need to be paired with sperm-specific glycolysis inhibitors.",,10.1101/2022.08.04.502752,http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.04.502752v1,2022.08.04.502752,8/5/2022,,,"Endocrinology Graduate Group, University of California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine; Department of Chemistry, University of California; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Dewpoint Therapeutics; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California, San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health; Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles; Department of Chemistry, University of California; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub; Department of Physiology, University of California San Francisco; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California; Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality, Buck Institute for Research on Aging",,,0,,

A notable example of such behavior is RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus with either pulsed or sustained dynamics, depending on the stimulus. Our understanding of how these dynamics are interpreted by downstream genes has remained incomplete, partly because ubiquitously used environmental inputs activate other transcriptional regulators in addition to RelA. Here, we use an optogenetic tool, CLASP (controllable light-activated shuttling and plasma membrane sequestration), to control RelA spatiotemporal dynamics in mouse fibroblasts and quantify their effect on downstream genes using RNA-seq. Using RelA-CLASP, we show for the first time that nuclear translocation of RelA, without post-translational modifications or activation of other transcriptional regulators, is sufficient to activate downstream genes. Furthermore, we find that TNFα, a common endogenous input, regulates many genes independently of RelA, and that this gene regulation is different from that induced by RelA-CLASP. Genes responsive to RelA-CLASP show a wide range of dynamics in response to a constant RelA input. We use a simple promoter model to recapitulate these diverse dynamic responses, as well as data collected in response to a pulsed RelA-CLASP input, and extract features of many RelA-responsive promoters. We also pinpoint many genes for which more complex models, involving feedback or multi-step promoters, may be needed to explain their response to constant and pulsed TF inputs.

While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers.

This task is particularly challenging for numerous biomedically important targets in human cells, including membrane proteins and large macromolecular assemblies, hampering mechanistic studies and drug development efforts. Here we describe a method combining CRISPR-Cas gene editing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to rapidly tag and purify endogenous proteins in HEK cells for structural characterization. We applied this approach to study the human proteasome from HEK cells and rapidly determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of major proteasomal complexes, including a high-resolution structure of intact human PA28αβ-20S. Our structures reveal that PA28 with a subunit stoichiometry of 3α/4β engages tightly with the 20S proteasome. Addition of a hydrophilic peptide shows that polypeptides entering through PA28 are held in the antechamber of 20S prior to degradation in the proteolytic chamber. This study provides critical insights into an important proteasome complex and demonstrates key methodologies for the tagging of proteins from endogenous sources.

Endogenous ligands for PPARγ are generated during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to fatty acids through the actions of lipases such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). To examine whether reduced production of endogenous PPARγ ligands would influence bone regeneration, we examined the effects of HSL knockout on fracture repair in mice using a tibial mono-cortical defect as a model. We found an improved rate of fracture repair in HSL-ko mice documented by serial μCT and bone histomorphometry compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, accelerated rates of bone regeneration were observed with a calvarial model where implantation of bone grafts from HSL-ko mice accelerated bone regeneration at the injury site. Further analysis revealed improved MSC differentiation down osteoblast and chondrocyte lineage with inhibition of HSL. MSC recruitment to the injury site was greater in HSL-ko mice than WT. Finally, we used single cell RNAseq to understand the osteoimmunological differences between WT and HSL-ko mice and found changes in the pre-osteoclast population. Our study shows HSL-ko mice as an interesting model to study improvements to bone injury repair. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential importance of pre-osteoclasts and osteoclasts in bone repair.
