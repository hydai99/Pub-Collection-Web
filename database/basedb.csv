Endogenous ligands for PPARγ are generated during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to fatty acids through the actions of lipases such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). To examine whether reduced production of endogenous PPARγ ligands would influence bone regeneration, we examined the effects of HSL knockout on fracture repair in mice using a tibial mono-cortical defect as a model. We found an improved rate of fracture repair in HSL-ko mice documented by serial μCT and bone histomorphometry compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, accelerated rates of bone regeneration were observed with a calvarial model where implantation of bone grafts from HSL-ko mice accelerated bone regeneration at the injury site. Further analysis revealed improved MSC differentiation down osteoblast and chondrocyte lineage with inhibition of HSL. MSC recruitment to the injury site was greater in HSL-ko mice than WT. Finally, we used single cell RNAseq to understand the osteoimmunological differences between WT and HSL-ko mice and found changes in the pre-osteoclast population.

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction.

Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1.

Whether ferroptosis sensitivity is governed by a single regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, based on the integration of 24 published chemical genetic screens combined with targeted follow-up experimentation, we find that the genetic regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity is highly variable and context-dependent. For example, the lipid metabolic gene acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) appears far more essential for ferroptosis triggered by direct inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) than by cystine deprivation. Despite this, distinct pro-ferroptotic stimuli converge upon a common lethal effector mechanism: accumulation of lipid peroxides at the plasma membrane.

Here, I examine the basic unit of organ-scale cell dynamics: the cellular life cycle of birth, differentiation, and death. Focusing on epithelial organs, I discuss how spatial patterns and temporal kinetics of life cycle stages depend upon lineage organization and tissue architecture. I review how signaling between stages coordinates life cycle dynamics to enforce homeostasis, and I highlight how particular stages are transiently unbalanced to drive organ resizing or repair. Finally, I offer that considering organs as a collective of not cells but rather cell life cycles provides a powerful vantage for deciphering homeostatic and non-homeostatic tissue states.",adaptation; differentiation; extrusion; feedback; stem cells; tissue homeostasis,,,,,2022-07-20,2022/07/18,2022/7/20,Lucy Erin O'Brien,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; email: lucye@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.","Lucy Erin O'Brien: Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; email: lucye@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.",,,,,,0

Currently, a significant fraction of children and adolescents worldwide experience insecure access to food. The goal of our work was to test in mice whether the transient experience of insecure versus secure access to food during the juvenile-adolescent period produced lasting differences in learning, decision-making, and the dopamine system in adulthood. We manipulated feeding schedules in mice from postnatal day (P)21 to P40 as food insecure or ad libitum and found that when tested in adulthood (after P60), males with different developmental feeding history showed significant differences in multiple metrics of cognitive flexibility in learning and decision-making. Adult females with different developmental feeding history showed no differences in cognitive flexibility but did show significant differences in adult weight. We next applied reinforcement learning models to these behavioral data. The best fit models suggested that in males, developmental feeding history altered how mice updated their behavior after negative outcomes. This effect was sensitive to task context and reward contingencies. Consistent with these results, in males, we found that the two feeding history groups showed significant differences in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio of excitatory synapses on nucleus-accumbens-projecting midbrain dopamine neurons and evoked dopamine release in dorsal striatal targets. Together, these data show in a rodent model that transient differences in feeding history in the juvenile-adolescent period can have significant impacts on adult weight, learning, decision-making, and dopamine neurobiology.","adaptive; cognitive flexibility; dopamine, sex differences, adolescent, reversal, adversity, mouse; feeding; food insecurity",,,,,2022-07-22,2022/07/20,2022/7/22,Wan Chen Lin; Christine Liu; Polina Kosillo; Lung-Hao Tai; Ezequiel Galarce; Helen S Bateup; Stephan Lammel; Linda Wilbrecht,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; Department of Psychology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.

We investigated how engagement with a reconstituted basement membrane in three dimensions (3D) supports the polarized, stress resilient tissue phenotype of mammary epithelial spheroids. Cells interacting with reconstituted basement membrane in 3D had reduced levels of total and actin-associated filamin and decreased cortical actin tension that increased plasma membrane protrusions to promote negative plasma membrane curvature and plasma membrane protein associations linked to protein secretion. By contrast, cells engaging a reconstituted basement membrane in 2D had high cortical actin tension that forced filamin unfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associations. Enhanced filamin-ER interactions increased levels of PKR-like ER kinase effectors and ER-plasma membrane contact sites that compromised calcium homeostasis and diminished cell viability. Consequently, cells with decreased cortical actin tension had reduced ER stress and survived better. Consistently, cortical actin tension in cellular spheroids regulated polarized basement membrane membrane deposition and sensitivity to exogenous stress. The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.",actin tension; endoplasmic reticulum;

Defects in alternative splicing are associated with many heart diseases, yet relatively little is known about how cell type- or cell state-specific alternative splicing is achieved in the heart. Here, we show that GATA4 regulates cell type-specific splicing through direct interaction with RNA and the spliceosome in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors.","GATA4 transcription factor;

We combine multiplexed CRISPRi screening with machine learning to define quantitative enhancer-enhancer interactions. We find that the ultralong distance enhancer network has a nested multilayer architecture that confers functional robustness of gene expression. Experimental characterization reveals that enhancer epistasis is maintained by three-dimensional chromosomal interactions and BRD4 condensation. Machine learning prediction of synergistic enhancers provides an effective strategy to identify noncoding variant pairs associated with pathogenic genes in diseases beyond genome-wide association studies analysis.

We sought to identify conserved and essential RNA secondary structures within IAV's genome that are predicted to have greater constraints on mutation in response to therapeutic targeting. We identified and genetically validated an RNA structure (packaging stem-loop 2 (PSL2)) that mediates in vitro packaging and in vivo disease and is conserved across all known IAV isolates. A PSL2-targeting locked nucleic acid (LNA), administered 3 d after, or 14 d before, a lethal IAV inoculum provided 100% survival in mice, led to the development of strong immunity to rechallenge with a tenfold lethal inoculum, evaded attempts to select for resistance and retained full potency against neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant virus. Use of an analogous approach to target SARS-CoV-2, prophylactic administration of LNAs specific for highly conserved RNA structures in the viral genome, protected hamsters from efficient transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 USA_WA1/2020 variant.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",DNA damage; SA-beta-Gal; cell cycle; cell size; p16(INK4); palbociclib; polyploidy; proteomics; senescence; size-scaling,,,,,2022-08-21,2022/08/19,2022/8/21,Michael C Lanz; Evgeny Zatulovskiy; Matthew P Swaffer; Lichao Zhang; Ilayda Ilerten; Shuyuan Zhang; Dong Shin You; Georgi Marinov; Patrick McAlpine; Joshua E Elias; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Treatments with X-ray and chemotherapy, on the other hand, cause major side-effects such as damage to surrounding normal brain tissues and other organs. Here we report the development of an integrated nanomedicine-bioelectronics brain-machine interface that enables continuous and on-demand treatment of brain tumours, without open-skull surgery and toxicological side-effects on other organs. Near-infrared surface plasmon characteristics of our gold nanostars enabled the precise treatment of deep brain tumours in freely behaving mice. Moreover, the nanostars' surface coating enabled their selective diffusion in tumour tissues after intratumoral administration, leading to the exclusive heating of tumours for treatment.

To explore this question, we generated genetically diverse phage-resistant mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We subjected the panel of mutants to prolonged experimental evolution in the absence of phages. Some populations re-evolved phage sensitivity, whereas others acquired compensatory mutations that reduced the costs of resistance without altering resistance levels. To ask whether these outcomes were driven by the initial genetic mechanisms of resistance, we next evolved independent replicates of each individual mutant in the absence of phages. We found a strong signature of historical contingency: some mutations were highly reversible across replicate populations, whereas others were highly entrenched. Through whole-genome sequencing of bacteria over time, we also found that populations with the same resistance gene acquired more parallel sets of mutations than populations with different resistance genes, suggesting that compensatory adaptation is also contingent on how resistance initially evolved. Our study identifies an evolutionary ratchet in bacteria-phage coevolution and may explain previous observations that resistance persists over time in some bacterial populations but is lost in others. We add to a growing body of work describing the key role of phages in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of their host communities. Beyond this specific trait, our study provides a new insight into the genetic architecture of historical contingency, a crucial component of interpreting and predicting evolution.",bacteriophages; epistasis; experimental evolution; historical contingency; microbial evolution; parallel evolution,,,,,2022-08-23,,2022/8/23,Reena Debray; Nina De Luna; Britt Koskella,,"Department of Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.","Reena Debray: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.Nina De Luna: Department of Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA.Britt Koskella: Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, CA, USA.",,,10.1101/2022.02.10.479996,,,0

Normally asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune dysfunction, and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth are not defined. Here, we show that control of mite HF colonization in mice required group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), interleukin-13 (IL-13), and its receptor, IL-4Ra-IL-13Ra1. HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice.

Further, FcRγ-/low NK cell subsets from healthy donors displayed reduced mTOR activity.

Here, we created a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library of knockdown strains covering all known essential genes in the biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis strain NCIB 3610 and investigated growth, biofilm colony wrinkling, and sporulation phenotypes of the knockdown library. First, we showed that gene essentiality is largely conserved between liquid and surface growth and between two media. Second, we quantified biofilm colony wrinkling using a custom image analysis algorithm and found that fatty acid synthesis and DNA gyrase knockdown strains exhibited increased wrinkling independent of biofilm matrix gene expression. Third, we designed a high-throughput screen to quantify sporulation efficiency after essential gene knockdown; we found that partial knockdowns of essential genes remained competent for sporulation in a sporulation-inducing medium, but knockdown of essential genes involved in fatty acid synthesis exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency in LB, a medium with generally lower levels of sporulation. We conclude that a subset of essential genes are particularly important for biofilm structure and sporulation/germination and suggest a previously unappreciated and multifaceted role for fatty acid synthesis in bacterial lifestyles and developmental processes.

PE is a multicomponent editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared with transfecting the PE components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles. Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.",disease models; genetics; genome engineering; genomics; hPSCs; human; parkinson's disease; prime editing; regenerative medicine; stem cells,,,,,2022-09-08,2022/09/07,2022/9/8,Hanqin Li; Oriol Busquets; Yogendra Verma; Khaja Mohieddin Syed; Nitzan Kutnowski; Gabriella R Pangilinan; Luke A Gilbert; Helen S Bateup; Donald C Rio; Dirk Hockemeyer; Frank Soldner,,"Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) Collaborative Research Network, Chevy Chase, United States.; Dominick P.

It is now possible to quantitatively measure the enhancer activity of thousands of HARs in parallel and model how each nucleotide contributes to gene expression. These strategies have revealed that many human HAR sequences function differently than their chimpanzee orthologs, though individual nucleotide changes in the same HAR may have opposite effects, consistent with compensatory substitutions.

Here, we report the 3.5 Å cryo-EM structure of SETD3 interacting with coxsackievirus B3 2A at two distinct interfaces, including the substrate-binding surface within the SET domain. Structure-function analysis revealed that mutations of key residues in the SET domain resulted in severely reduced binding to 2A and complete protection from enteroviral infection.

These mostly ineffective antibodies target variable epitopes. Here we describe broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors developed by tethering the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to known non-neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved epitopes in the viral spike protein. These inhibitors, called receptor-blocking conserved non-neutralizing antibodies (ReconnAbs), potently neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. Neutralization potency is lost when the linker joining the binding and inhibitory ReconnAb components is severed. In addition, a bi-functional ReconnAb, made by linking ACE2 to a bi-specific antibody targeting two non-overlapping conserved epitopes, defined here, shows sub-nanomolar neutralizing activity against all VOCs, including Omicron and BA.2. Given their conserved targets and modular nature, ReconnAbs have the potential to act as broad-spectrum therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pandemic diseases.",,,,,,2022-09-09,2022/09/08,2022/9/9,Payton A-B Weidenbacher; Eric Waltari; Izumi de Los Rios Kobara; Benjamin N Bell; Mary Kate Morris; Ya-Chen Cheng; Carl Hanson; John E Pak; Peter S Kim,,"California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.","Payton A-B Weidenbacher: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Eric Waltari: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Izumi de Los Rios Kobara: Stanford Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Benjamin N Bell: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Mary Kate Morris: California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.Ya-Chen Cheng: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Carl Hanson: California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.John E Pak: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Peter S Kim: Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. kimpeter@stanford.edu.",,,,,,0

Nsp14 forms a stable complex with non-structural protein Nsp10 and exhibits exoribonuclease and N7-methyltransferase activities. Protein-interactome studies identified human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a putative binding partner of Nsp14. SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments. SIRT5 knock-out cells expressed higher basal levels of innate immunity markers and mounted a stronger antiviral response, independently of the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling Protein MAVS.

One of the biggest problems is discriminating true signal generated by target molecules versus non-specific background. Here, we developed a Single-Molecule Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) that overcomes this problem by employing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to quantify target proteins based on the colocalization of fluorescent signal from orthogonally labeled capture and detection antibodies. By specifically counting colocalized signals, we can eliminate the effects of background produced by non-specific binding of detection antibodies. Using TNF-α, we show that SiMCA achieves a three-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays and exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such as serum and blood.

Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",,,,,,2022-09-16,2022/09/15,2022/9/16,Brent Townshend; Matias Kaplan; Christina D Smolke,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.","Brent Townshend: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Matias Kaplan: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.Christina D Smolke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.",,,10.1101/2022.07.16.500284,,,0

However, the size and complexity of these Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes it difficult to perform exploratory analyses. To aid in data exploration, we have developed AIRRscape, an R Shiny-based interactive web browser application that enables B-cell receptor (BCR) and antibody feature discovery through comparisons among multiple repertoires. Using AIRR-seq data as input, AIRRscape starts by aggregating and sorting repertoires into interactive and explorable bins of germline V-gene, germline J-gene, and CDR3 length, providing a high-level view of the entire repertoire. Interesting subsets of repertoires can be quickly identified and selected, and then network topologies of CDR3 motifs can be generated for further exploration. Here we demonstrate AIRRscape using patient BCR repertoires and sequences of published monoclonal antibodies to investigate patterns of humoral immunity to three viral pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and DENV (dengue virus). AIRRscape reveals convergent antibody sequences among datasets for all three pathogens, although HIV-1 antibody datasets display limited convergence and idiosyncratic responses.

As cell size increases, some proteins become more concentrated while others are diluted. As a result, the state of the cell changes continuously with increasing size. In addition to these proteomic changes, large cells have a lower growth rate (protein synthesis rate per unit volume). That both the cell's proteome and growth rate change with cell size suggests they may be interdependent. To test this, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to measure how the proteome changes in response to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which decreases the cellular growth rate and has only a minimal effect on cell size. We found that large cell size and mTOR inhibition, both of which lower the growth rate of a cell, remodel the proteome in similar ways. This suggests that many of the effects of cell size are mediated by the size-dependent slowdown of the cellular growth rate. For example, the previously reported size-dependent expression of some senescence markers could reflect a cell's declining growth rate rather than its size ",cell size; growth rate; mTOR; protein synthesis rate; quantitative proteomics; rapamycin; senescence,,,,,2022-09-23,2022/09/05,2022/9/23,Evgeny Zatulovskiy; Michael C Lanz; Shuyuan Zhang; Frank McCarthy; Joshua E Elias; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.","Evgeny Zatulovskiy: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.Michael C Lanz: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Shuyuan Zhang: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.Frank McCarthy: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Joshua E Elias: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.Jan M Skotheim: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA, United States.",,,,,,0

This matrix is estimated from fluxes between communities, obtained from cell-phone tracking data recorded in the USA between March 2020 and February 2021. We apply this model to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by fitting just one global parameter representing the frequency of interaction between individuals. We find that the predicted infections agree reasonably well with the reported cases. We clearly see the effect of ""shelter-in-place"" policies introduced at the onset of the pandemic. Interestingly, a model with uniform transmission rates produces similar results, suggesting that the epidemic transmission was deeply influenced by air travel. We then study the effect of alternative mitigation policies, in particular restricting long-range travel.

However, its spatial and temporal resolution largely relies on the brightness of ON/OFF switchable fluorescent dyes. Moreover, in cell plasma membranes, the single-molecule localization is hampered by the fast lateral diffusion of membrane probes. Here, to address these two fundamental problems, we propose a concept of ON/OFF switchable probes for SMLM (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography, PAINT) based on fluorogenic dimers of bright cyanine dyes. In these probes, the two cyanine units connected with a linker were modified at their extremities with low-affinity membrane anchors. Being self-quenched in water due to intramolecular dye H-aggregation, they displayed light up on reversible binding to lipid membranes. The charged group in the linker further decreased the probe affinity to the lipid membranes, thus accelerating its dynamic reversible ON/OFF switching. The concept was validated on cyanines 3 and 5. SMLM of live cells revealed that the new probes provided higher brightness and ∼10-fold slower diffusion at the cell surface, compared to reference probes Nile Red and DiD, which boosted axial localization precision >3-fold down to 31 nm. The new probe allowed unprecedented observation of nanoscale fibrous protrusions on plasma membranes of live cells with 40 s time resolution, revealing their fast dynamics. Thus, going beyond the brightness limit of single switchable dyes by cooperative dequenching in fluorogenic dimers and slowing down probe diffusion in biomembranes open the route to significant enhancement of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of live cells.",,,,,,2022-09-27,2022/09/26,2022/9/27,Ilya O Aparin; Rui Yan; Rémi Pelletier; Alexander A Choi; Dmytro I Danylchuk; Ke Xu; Andrey S Klymchenko,,"Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.; Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.","Ilya O Aparin: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Rui Yan: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Rémi Pelletier: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Alexander A Choi: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Dmytro I Danylchuk: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.Ke Xu: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California 94158, United States.Andrey S Klymchenko: Laboratoire de Bioimagerie et Pathologies, UMR 7021 CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, 74 Route du Rhin, 67401 Illkirch, France.",,,,,,0

Given that brief intervention can effectively reduce hazardous alcohol consumption, this study aimed to investigate how hypertensive patients with concomitant alcohol use are identified and treated in Thai primary care settings and what this may mean for screening and lifestyle intervention strategies. In a cross-sectional, mixed-method design, we surveyed 91 participants from three different groups of Thai stakeholders: policy- and decisionmakers; healthcare practitioners; and patients diagnosed with hypertension. Data was collected between December 2020 and May 2021. Responses were analyzed descriptively and using open coding tools to identify current practices, barriers, facilitators, and implications for interventions. All stakeholder groups regarded alcohol use as an important driver of hypertension. While lifestyle interventions among hypertensive patients were perceived as beneficial, current lifestyle support was limited. Barriers included limited resources in primary healthcare facilities, lack of continuous monitoring or follow-up, missing tools or procedures for risk assessment and lifestyle intervention, and stigmatization of alcohol use. Our results suggest that although screening for lifestyle risk factors (including alcohol use) and lifestyle interventions are not yet sufficiently established, a wide range of stakeholders still recognize the potential of interventions targeted at hazardous alcohol use among hypertensive patients.

Here, we utilize a sperm penetration assay as a model system to investigate the function of human TMEM95. We show that human TMEM95 binds to hamster egg membranes, providing evidence for a TMEM95 receptor on eggs. Using X-ray crystallography, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved, positively charged region of TMEM95 as a putative receptor-binding surface. Amino acid substitutions within this region of TMEM95 ablate egg-binding activity. We identify monoclonal antibodies against TMEM95 that reduce the number of human sperm fused with hamster eggs in sperm penetration assays.

Leveraging this hypothesis, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have assisted in both the interpretation and discovery of additional genes associated with complex traits. However, existing methods for conducting TWAS do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We introduce CONTENT-a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We apply CONTENT to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell RNA-seq data sets and show that CONTENT leads to a 42% (bulk) and 110% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. We find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75% in single-cell data, consistent with cell-type heterogeneity in bulk tissue. In the context of TWAS, CONTENT increases the number of locus-phenotype associations discovered by over 51% relative to previous methods across 22 complex traits.",,,,,,2022-09-29,2022/09/28,2022/9/29,Mike Thompson; Mary Grace Gordon; Andrew Lu; Anchit Tandon; Eran Halperin; Alexander Gusev; Chun Jimmie Ye; Brunilda Balliu; Noah Zaitlen,,"Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Biological and Medical Informatics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. mjthompson@ucla.edu.; Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.; Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.; Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Human Genetics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, Delhi, India.; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, US.; Division of Genetics, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, US.; UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.","Mike Thompson: Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. mjthompson@ucla.edu.Mary Grace Gordon: Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Biological and Medical Informatics Graduate Program, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Andrew Lu: UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Anchit Tandon: Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, Delhi, India.Eran Halperin: Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Human Genetics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Alexander Gusev: Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, US.; Division of Genetics, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, US.Chun Jimmie Ye: Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Computational Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Brunilda Balliu: Department of Computational Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.Noah Zaitlen: Department of Computer Science, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.; Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. nzaitlen@ucla.edu.",,,10.1101/2021.09.23.461579,,,0

To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from 'sizers', in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to 'adders', in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks. If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells in vivo, sizers become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for the fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i>. For some size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division cycle of the green algae <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. That these size control networks evolved such self-organized criticality shows how the evolution of complex systems can drive the emergence of critical processes.",S. cerevisiae; S. pombe; cell cycle; chlamydomonas; chlamydomonas reinhardtii; computational biology; gene networks; mathematical modelling; systems biology,,,,,2022-10-01,2022/09/30,2022/10/1,Felix Proulx-Giraldeau; Jan M Skotheim; Paul François,,"Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.; Department of Physics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.","Felix Proulx-Giraldeau: Department of Physics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.Jan M Skotheim: Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.Paul François: Department of Physics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.",,,10.1101/2022.04.12.488093,,,0

Our objectives were to characterize the phenotype of patients with Nodding Syndrome, investigate potential contributors to disease etiology, and evaluate response to immunotherapy. This cohort study investigated members of a single-family unit from Lamwo District, Uganda. The participants for this study were selected by the Ugandan Ministry of Health as representative for Nodding Syndrome and with a conducive family structure for genomic analyses. Of the eight family members who participated in the study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, three had Nodding Syndrome. The three affected patients were extensively evaluated with metagenomic sequencing for infectious pathogens, exome sequencing, spinal fluid immune analyses, neurometabolic and toxicology testing, continuous electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. Five unaffected family members underwent a subset of testing for comparison. A distinctive interictal pattern of sleep-activated bursts of generalized and multifocal epileptiform discharges and slowing was observed in two patients. Brain imaging showed two patients had mild generalized cerebral atrophy, and both patients and unaffected family members had excessive metal deposition in the basal ganglia. Trace metal biochemical evaluation was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was non-inflammatory, and one patient had CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands. Onchocerca volvulus specific antibodies were present in all patients and skin snips were negative for active onchocerciasis. Metagenomic sequencing of serum and CSF revealed hepatitis B virus in the serum of one patient. Vitamin B6 metabolites were borderline low in all family members, and CSF pyridoxine metabolites were normal. Mitochondrial DNA testing was normal. Exome sequencing did not identify potentially causal candidate gene variants. Nodding Syndrome is characterized by a distinctive pattern of sleep-activated epileptiform activity. The associated growth stunting may be due to hypothalamic dysfunction. Extensive testing years after disease onset did not clarify a causal etiology.

Further, a high percentage of NMIBC patients treated with BCG suffer unwanted effects that force them to stop treatment. Thus, early identification of patients in which BCG treatment will fail is really important. Here, to identify early stage non-invasive biomarkers of non-responder patients and patients at risk of abandoning the treatment, we longitudinally analysed the phenotype of cells released into the urine of bladder cancer patients 3-7 days after BCG instillations.

Current serology assays either require a laboratory setting and take >1 hr (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) or are rapid but only qualitative in nature and cannot accurately track antibody levels over time (i.e., lateral flow assay [LFA]). Therefore, there is a need for development of a rapid and simple but also quantitative assay that can evaluate antibody levels in patients accurately over time. We have developed an assay that uses a split nanoluciferase fused to the spike or nucleocapsid proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enable luminescent-based detection of spike- or nucleocapsid-binding antibodies in serum, plasma, and whole blood samples. The resulting approach is simple, rapid, and quantitative and is highly amenable to low-/medium-throughput scale using plate-based assays, high-throughput scale using robotics, and point-of-care applications. In this article, we describe how to perform the assay in a laboratory setting using a plate reader or liquid-handling robotics and in a point-of-care setting using a handheld, battery-powered luminometer. Together, these assays allow antibody detection to be easily performed in multiple settings by simplifying and reducing assay time in a laboratory or clinical environment and by allowing for antibody detection in point-of-care, nonlaboratory settings. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

As obligate pathogens of erythrocytes, the Plasmodium spp. parasites that cause malaria must exploit erythroid host factors for their survival. However, our understanding of this important aspect of the malaria lifecycle is limited, in part because erythrocytes are enucleated cells that lack a nucleus and DNA, rendering them genetically intractable. Recent advances in genetic analysis of the erythroid lineage using small-hairpin RNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) in red-blood cells derived from stem cells have generated new insights into the functions of several candidate host factors for Plasmodium parasites.

Plasma RNA also yielded a transcriptional signature of sepsis with several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers, and a bSVM sepsis diagnostic classifier (AUC = 0.97 training set; AUC = 0.77 validation set). Pathogen detection performance of plasma mNGS varied on the basis of pathogen and site of infection. To improve detection of virus, we developed a secondary transcriptomic classifier (AUC = 0.94 training set; AUC = 0.96 validation set).

This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering.

CoQ is synthesized upon the mitochondrial inner membrane by an ill-defined ""complex Q"" metabolon. Here, we present structure-function analyses of a lipid-, substrate-, and NADH-bound complex comprising two complex Q subunits: the hydroxylase COQ7 and the lipid-binding protein COQ9. We reveal that COQ7 adopts a ferritin-like fold with a hydrophobic channel whose substrate-binding capacity is enhanced by COQ9. Using molecular dynamics, we further show that two COQ7:COQ9 heterodimers form a curved tetramer that deforms the membrane, potentially opening a pathway for the CoQ intermediates to translocate from the bilayer to the proteins' lipid-binding sites. Two such tetramers assemble into a soluble octamer with a pseudo-bilayer of lipids captured within. Together, these observations indicate that COQ7 and COQ9 cooperate to access hydrophobic precursors within the membrane and coordinate subsequent synthesis steps toward producing CoQ.",COQ7; COQ9; coenzyme Q; di-iron proteins; mitochondria; protein-lipid complex; protein-membrane interaction; quinone biosynthesis,,,,,2022-10-29,2022/10/21,2022/10/29,Mateusz Manicki; Halil Aydin; Luciano A Abriata; Katherine A Overmyer; Rachel M Guerra; Joshua J Coon; Matteo Dal Peraro; Adam Frost; David J Pagliarini,,"Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and Altos Labs Bay Area Institute of Science, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Adults, termed zooids, are filter feeding individuals. Sister zooids group together to form modules and modules in turn are linked by a shared vascular network to form a well-integrated colony. Zooids undergo a weekly cycle of regression and renewal during which mature zooids are replaced by developing buds. The zooid brain matures and degenerates on this 7-day cycle. We used focal extracellular recording and video imaging to explore brain activity in the context of development and degeneration and to examine the contributions of the nervous system and vascular network to behavior. Recordings from the brain revealed complex firing patterns arising both spontaneously and in response to stimulation. Neural activity increase as the brain matures and declines thereafter. Motor behavior follows the identical time course. The behavior of each zooid is guided predominantly by its individual brain but sister zooids can also exhibit synchronous motor behavior. The vascular network also generates action potentials that are largely independent of neural activity. In addition, the entire vascular network undergoes slow rhythmic contractions that appear to arise from processes endogenous to vascular epithelial cells. We found that neurons in the brain and cells of the vascular network both express multiple genes for voltage gated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels homologous (based on sequence) to mammalian ion channel genes.",Colonial tunicate; Excitable epithelium; Neural activity; Synchronous and autonomous behavior,,,,,2022-11-01,2022/10/31,2022/11/1,Stuart H Thompson; Chiara Anselmi; Katherine J Ishizuka; Karla J Palmeri; Ayelet N Voskoboynik,,"Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.; Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco CA 94158, USA.","Stuart H Thompson: Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.Chiara Anselmi: Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.Katherine J Ishizuka: Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Karla J Palmeri: Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Ayelet N Voskoboynik: Department of Biology and Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 93950, USA.; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco CA 94158, USA.",,,,,,0

In cancer, this compartment is critical not only for defining tumor biology but also serves as a rich source of potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Recently, we profiled the surfaceome of the blood cancer multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell malignancy. While available small molecule agents can drive initial remissions in myeloma, resistance inevitably occurs. Several new classes of immunotherapies targeting myeloma surface antigens, including antibody therapeutics and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, can further prolong survival. However, new approaches are still needed for those who relapse. We thus applied the glycoprotein cell surface capture (CSC) methodology to panel of multiple myeloma cell lines, identifying key surface protein features of malignant plasma cells. We characterized the most abundant surface proteins on plasma cells, nominating CD48 as a high-density antigen favorable for a possible avidity-based strategy to enhance CAR-T efficacy. After chronic resistance to proteasome inhibitors, a first-line therapy, we found significant alterations in the surface profile of myeloma cells, including down-regulation of CD50, CD361/EVI2B, and CD53, while resistance to another first-line therapy, lenalidomide, drove increases in CD33 and CD45/PTPRC. In contrast, short-term treatment with lenalidomide led to upregulation of the surface antigen MUC-1, thereby enhancing efficacy of MUC-1 targeting CAR-T cells. Integrating our proteomics data with available transcriptome datasets, we developed a scoring system to rank potential standalone immunotherapy targets. Novel targets of interest included CCR10, TXNDC11, and LILRB4. We developed proof-of-principle CAR-T cells versus CCR10 using its natural ligand, CCL27, as an antigen recognition domain. Finally, we developed a ""miniaturized"" version of the CSC methodology and applied it to primary myeloma patient specimens. Overall, our work creates a unique resource for the myeloma community. This study also supports unbiased surface proteomic profiling as a fruitful strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets and markers of drug resistance, that could have utility in improving myeloma patient outcomes.

Pathological transformation of astrocytes to reactive states can be protective or harmful to BBB function. Here, using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB co-culture model, we show that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transitions astrocytes to an inflammatory reactive state that causes BBB dysfunction through activation of STAT3 and increased expression of SERPINA3, which encodes alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (α1ACT). To contextualize these findings, we correlated astrocytic STAT3 activation to vascular inflammation in postmortem human tissue. Further, in murine brain organotypic cultures, astrocyte-specific silencing of Serpina3n reduced vascular inflammation after TNF challenge. Last, treatment with recombinant Serpina3n in both ex vivo explant cultures and in vivo was sufficient to induce BBB dysfunction-related molecular changes.

While the shared data between the cores correlate well, there is considerable heterogeneity in the data retrieved from different cores. Specifically, out of 4022 identified unique proteins, only 73 (1.8%) are shared across the core facilities providing semiquantitative analysis.

In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al., 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.",cell biology; chromosome segregation; coarse-grained modeling; mechanics; microtubules; p. tridactylis; physics of living systems; spindle,,,,,2022-11-09,2022/11/08,2022/11/9,Pooja Suresh; Vahe Galstyan; Rob Phillips; Sophie Dumont,,"Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics Option, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States.; A.

Here, we introduce ""CAR Pooling,"" a multiplexed approach to rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells. CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism. BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic transcriptional signature previously associated with positive clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain in a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. Together, these results show that CAR Pooling is a general approach for rapid exploration of CAR architecture and activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies.",,,,,,2022-11-10,2022/11/09,2022/11/10,Daniel B Goodman;

Our data suggest that this biophysical defect leads to cell-cycle arrest, shutdown of Pol I-mediated transcription, and ultimately cell death.

The bacterial actin homolog MreB, which is essential for cell-shape determination in many rod-shaped bacteria, has served as a model system for studying the mechanics of cytoskeletal filaments. Previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the twist of MreB double protofilaments is dependent on the bound nucleotide, as well as binding to the membrane or the accessory protein RodZ, and MreB mutations that modulate twist also affect MreB spatial organization and cell shape. Here, we show that MreB double protofilaments can adopt multiple twist states during microsecond-scale MD simulations. A deep learning algorithm trained only on high- and low-twist states robustly identified all twist conformations across most perturbations of ATP-bound MreB, suggesting the existence of a conserved set of states whose occupancy is affected by each perturbation to MreB. Simulations replacing ATP with ADP indicated that twist states were generally stable after hydrolysis. These findings suggest a rich twist landscape that could provide the capacity to tune MreB activity and therefore its effects on cell shape.",Actin homologs; Bacterial cytoskeleton; Chiral twist; Deep learning; DiffNets; Molecular dynamics,,,,,2022-11-17,2022/10/07,2022/11/17,Benjamin D Knapp; Michael D Ward; Gregory R Bowman; Handuo Shi; Kerwyn Casey Huang,,"Biophysics Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Biophysics Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.; Center for the Science and Engineering of Living Systems, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.","Benjamin D Knapp: Biophysics Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Michael D Ward: Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.; Center for the Science and Engineering of Living Systems, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.Gregory R Bowman: Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.; Center for the Science and Engineering of Living Systems, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.Handuo Shi: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.Kerwyn Casey Huang: Biophysics Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.",,,,,,0

106.0,2022-11-17,,,,Sarah Wetzel,"Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Heidelberg University",medRxiv,10.1101/2022.11.11.22282234,,Changing socioeconomic and geographic gradients in cardiovascular disease risk factors in India -- Evidence from nationally representative household surveys,http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/13/2022.11.11.22282234,"BackgroundCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). CVDs and their metabolic risk factors have historically been concentrated among urban residents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) in LMICs such as India. However, as India develops, it is unclear whether these socioeconomic and geographic gradients will persist or change. Understanding these social dynamics in CVD risk is essential for mitigating the rising burden of CVDs and to reach those with the greatest needs.

MethodsUsing nationally representative data with biomarker measurements from the fourth (2015-16) and fifth (2019-21) Indian National Family and Health Surveys, we investigated trends in the prevalence of four CVD risk factors: tobacco consumption (self-reported, any type), unhealthy weight [Formula], idiabetes (random plasma glucose concentration [&ge;]200mg/dL or self-reported diabetes), and hypertension (one of: average systolic blood pressure [&ge;] 140mmHg, average diastolic blood pressure [&ge;] 90mmHg, self-reported past diagnosis, or self-reported current antihypertensive medication use) among adults aged 15-49 years. We first described changes at the national level and then trends stratified by place of residence (urban versus rural), geographic region (northern, northeastern, central, eastern, western, southern), regional level of development (Empowered Action Group member state or not), and two measures of socioeconomic status: level of education (no education, primary incomplete, primary complete, secondary incomplete, secondary complete, higher) and wealth (quintiles).

FindingsUnhealthy weight increased among all social and geographic groups but both the absolute and the relative changes were substantially higher among people with low SES (as measured by education or wealth) and in rural areas. For diabetes and hypertension, the prevalence increased for those from disadvantaged groups while staying constant or even decreasing among the wealthier and more educated. In contrast, tobacco consumption declined for all social and geographic groups.

InterpretationIn 2015-16, CVD risk factors were higher among more advantaged subpopulations in India. However, between 2015-16 and 2019-21, the prevalence of these risk factors grew more rapidly for less wealthy and less educated subpopulations and those living in rural areas. These trends have resulted in CVD risk becoming far more widespread throughout the population; CVD can no longer be characterized as a wealthy urban phenomenon.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for work published between Jan 1, 1990, and Sep 23, 2022, with variations of the search terms ""reversal hypothesis"", ""social gradient"", ""socioeconomic gradient"", ""social difference"", ""socioeconomic difference"", ""socioeconomic status"", ""change"", ""trend"", ""cardiovascular disease"", ""cardiovascular risk factor"", ""diabetes"", ""hypertension"", ""overweight"", ""obesity"", ""smoking"", ""tobacco"", ""low-income"", ""lower-middle-income"", and ""India"" in the title or abstract. Existing studies on changes in the socioeconomic patterning of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors mostly compared the size of social gradients in obesity cross-sectionally between countries at different levels of national income or development. These studies generally found higher obesity among higher socioeconomic status (SES) populations but opposite gradients for countries at higher levels of development. However, because these studies use cross-sectional comparisons, whether these patterns reflect the influence of development or other contextual factors associated with countries at different levels of development is unclear. Both for obesity and for other CVD risk factors, we found few nationally-representative studies that traced how gradients within countries changed over time as they developed. Importantly, most of these studies did not focus on India and those that did only considered single risk factors such as obesity using older data. Existing nationally representative research on India is thus predominantly cross-sectional and has only focused on the size of social gradients at single points in time. This work generally finds higher levels of unhealthy weight, diabetes, and hypertension among wealthy and educated subpopulations but lower levels of tobacco consumption. Subnational and smaller non-representative studies from India that traced changes in CVD risk factors over time provide some evidence of reversing or flattening gradients but it is unclear whether these patterns hold at regional and national levels.

Added value of this studyUsing data from the 2015-16 and 2019-2021 National Family and Health Surveys, we provide some of the first nationally representative evidence for trends in the prevalence of major CVD risk factors in India and how these trends have changed across social and geographic groups. Both absolute and relative increases in prevalence were far more pronounced among relatively poor and less educated populations. As a result of these trends, most CVD risk factors became more equal across population groups, or in some cases, became higher among the less compared to more educated.

Implications of all the available evidenceIndians with lower SES - as measured by wealth and education - experienced considerable adverse trends in unhealthy weight, diabetes, and hypertension between 2015-16 and 2019-21. Our results reveal that CVDs can no longer be considered a problem of the affluent parts of society and suggest that CVD prevention efforts that reach less advantaged subpopulations are urgently needed.",,,medrxiv;2022.11.11.22282234,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,2022-01-13,01/13/2022,,Sarah Wetzel; Pascal Geldsetzer; Sneha Sarah Mani; Aashish Gupta; Kavita Singh; Mohammed K.
