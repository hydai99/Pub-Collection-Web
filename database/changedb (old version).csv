This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering. The application of CRISPR technology to edit the non-coding genome, modulate gene regulation, make precise genetic changes and target infectious diseases has the potential to lead to curative therapies for many previously untreatable diseases.",,,,,,2022-10-26 00:00:00,2022/10/24,2022/10/26,Michael Chavez; Xinyi Chen; Paul B Finn; Lei S Qi,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.","Michael Chavez: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Xinyi Chen: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Paul B Finn: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Lei S Qi: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.",,,,,,0

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single-cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both the liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization. Our work highlights the power and necessity of type-specific neuronal access and time-lapse imaging in identifying wiring mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of functional neural maps.",,,biorxiv;2022.12.28.522173,1.0,new results,12/29/2022,12/29/2022,,Kenneth Kin Lam Wong; Tongchao Li; Tian-Ming Fu; Gaoxiang Liu; Cheng Lyu; Sayeh Kohani; Qijing Xie; David J Luginbuhl; Srigokul Upadhyayula; Eric Betzig; Liqun Luo,"Wong, K.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single-cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both the liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

We find that while mammals resemble one another in total TE content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly LINEs, drive increases in genome size while DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to accumulate only a few types of TE at any given time, with one TE type dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental mammals.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

Almost three decades ago, Tonerand Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, orherds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of theToner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve thegoverning equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developedformalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scatteringobstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results toanalytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature,moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on avariety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients anddynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatileincorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps ofparameter space.

In recent years, manyadvancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines,and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especiallycomplex polygonal geometries.

Theresult embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream taskssuch as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. Toachieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirableproperties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutationinvariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties.

Existinginformation-theoretic BO procedures aim to make queries that most reduce theuncertainty about optima, where the uncertainty is captured by Shannon entropy.However, an optimal measure of uncertainty would, ideally, factor in how weintend to use the inferred quantity in some downstream procedure. In thispaper, we instead consider a generalization of Shannon entropy from work instatistical decision theory (DeGroot 1962, Rao 1984), which contains a broadclass of uncertainty measures parameterized by a problem-specific loss functioncorresponding to a downstream task. We first show that special cases of thisentropy lead to popular acquisition functions used in BO procedures such asknowledge gradient, expected improvement, and entropy search. We then show howalternative choices for the loss yield a flexible family of acquisitionfunctions that can be customized for use in novel optimization settings.Additionally, we develop gradient-based methods to efficiently optimize ourproposed family of acquisition functions, and demonstrate strong empiricalperformance on a diverse set of sequential decision making tasks, includingvariants of top-$k$ optimization, multi-level set estimation, and sequencesearch.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01383,arXiv:2210.01383v1,,,2022-10-04 00:00:00,10/04/2022,,Willie Neiswanger; Lantao Yu; Shengjia Zhao; Chenlin Meng; Stefano Ermon,,,,,,,,,0

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications. Therefore, we present a call to action tothe AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promisingdirections for future work in the space of AutoML for CCAI.

Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested.

One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS.

Herewe study user engagement patterns within a mobile physical activity trackingapplication consisting of 115 million logged activities taken by over a millionusers over 31 months. Specifically, we show that over 75% of users return andre-engage with the application after prolonged periods of inactivity, no matterthe duration of the inactivity. We find a surprising result that there-engagement usage patterns resemble those of the start of the initialengagement period, rather than being a simple continuation of the end of theinitial engagement period. This evidence points to a conceptual model ofmultiple lives of user engagement, extending the prevalent single life view ofuser activity. We demonstrate that these multiple lives occur because the usershave a variety of different primary intents or goals for using the app. We findevidence for users being more likely to stop using the app once they achievedtheir primary intent or goal (e.g., weight loss).

Accurately predictinghuman actions is essential for targeted recommendations that could improve ourhealth and for personalization of these applications. However, making suchpredictions is extremely difficult due to the complexities of human behavior,which consists of a large number of potential actions that vary over time,depend on each other, and are periodic. Previous work has not jointly modeledthese dynamics and has largely focused on item consumption patterns instead ofbroader types of behaviors such as eating, commuting or exercising. In thiswork, we develop a novel statistical model for Time-varying, Interdependent,and Periodic Action Sequences. Our approach is based on personalized,multivariate temporal point processes that model time-varying actionpropensities through a mixture of Gaussian intensities. Our model capturesshort-term and long-term periodic interdependencies between actions throughHawkes process-based self-excitations.

The advantage of knockoff isthat if we have a good model of the features X, then we can identify salientfeatures without knowing anything about how the outcome Y depends on X. Animportant drawback of knockoffs is its instability: running the procedure twicecan result in very different selected features, potentially leading todifferent conclusions. Addressing this instability is critical for obtainingreproducible and robust results. Here we present a generalization of theknockoff procedure that we call simultaneous multi-knockoffs. We show thatmulti-knockoff guarantees false discovery rate (FDR) control, and issubstantially more stable and powerful compared to the standard (single)knockoff.

Here we provide an empirical studyon 34 proteins supporting the idea that allosteric conformational changegenerally occurs along a soft elastic mode presenting extended regions of highshear. We argue, based on a detailed analysis of how the energy profile alongsuch a mode depends on binding, that in the induced fit scenario there is anoptimal stiffness $k_a^*\sim 1/N$ for cooperative binding, where $N$ is thenumber of residues involved in the allosteric response. We find that thepopulation shift scenario is more robust to mutation affecting stiffness, asbinding becomes more and more cooperative with stiffness up to the samecharacteristic value $k_a^*$, beyond which cooperativity saturates instead ofdecaying. We confirm numerically these findings in a non-linear mechanicalmodel. Dynamical considerations suggest that a stiffness of order $k_a^*$ isfavorable in that scenario as well, supporting that for proper functionproteins must evolve a functional elastic mode that is softer as their sizeincreases.

However, they can beprohibitively expensive to apply in deep learning because they depend onfeature representations that need to be learned. In this work, we show that wecan greatly improve the computational efficiency by using a small proxy modelto perform data selection (e.g., selecting data points to label for activelearning). By removing hidden layers from the target model, using smallerarchitectures, and training for fewer epochs, we create proxies that are anorder of magnitude faster to train. Although these small proxy models havehigher error rates, we find that they empirically provide useful signals fordata selection. We evaluate this ""selection via proxy"" (SVP) approach onseveral data selection tasks across five datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet,Amazon Review Polarity, and Amazon Review Full. For active learning, applyingSVP can give an order of magnitude improvement in data selection runtime (i.e.,the time it takes to repeatedly train and select points) without significantlyincreasing the final error (often within 0.1%). For core-set selection onCIFAR10, proxies that are over 10x faster to train than their larger, moreaccurate targets can remove up to 50% of the data without harming the finalaccuracy of the target, leading to a 1.6x end-to-end training time improvement.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11829,arXiv:1906.11829v4,,,06/26/2019,06/26/2019,,Cody Coleman; Christopher Yeh; Stephen Mussmann; Baharan Mirzasoleiman; Peter Bailis; Percy Liang; Jure Leskovec; Matei Zaharia,,,,,,,,,0

In a national election, politicians would like to have persuasivespeakers campaign on their behalf. When a company faces adverse publicity, theywould like to engage persuasive advocates for their position in the presence ofadversaries who are critical of them. Debates represent a common platform forthese forms of adversarial persuasion. This paper solves two problems: theDebate Outcome Prediction (DOP) problem predicts who wins a debate while theIntensity of Persuasion Prediction (IPP) problem predicts the change in thenumber of votes before and after a speaker speaks. Though DOP has beenpreviously studied, we are the first to study IPP. Past studies on DOP fail toleverage two important aspects of multimodal data: 1) multiple modalities areoften semantically aligned, and 2) different modalities may provide diverseinformation for prediction. Our M2P2 (Multimodal Persuasion Prediction)framework is the first to use multimodal (acoustic, visual, language) data tosolve the IPP problem. To leverage the alignment of different modalities whilemaintaining the diversity of the cues they provide, M2P2 devises a noveladaptive fusion learning framework which fuses embeddings obtained from twomodules -- an alignment module that extracts shared information betweenmodalities and a heterogeneity module that learns the weights of differentmodalities with guidance from three separately trained unimodal referencemodels.

Here we propose COMET, ameta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learnalong human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a jointunstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts intosemi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs ofindependent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks fromdiverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, documentcategorization and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biologicaldomain developed in our work. COMET significantly outperforms strongmeta-learning baselines, achieving 6-15% relative improvement on the mostchallenging 1-shot learning tasks, while unlike existing methods providinginterpretations behind the model's predictions.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07375,arXiv:2007.07375v3,,,07/14/2020,07/14/2020,,Kaidi Cao; Maria Brbic; Jure Leskovec,,,,,,,,,0

Unfortunately, progress in the development of such platforms hasbeen hindered by the fact that mobile ions present in biological samples screencharges from the target molecule, greatly reducing sensor sensitivity. Underphysiological conditions, the thickness of the resulting electric double layeris less than 1 nm, and it has generally been assumed that electronic detectionbeyond this distance is virtually impossible. However, a few recently-describedsensor design strategies seem to defy this conventional wisdom, exploiting thephysics of electrical double layers in ways that traditional models do notcapture. In the first strategy, charge screening is decreased by constrainingthe space in which double layers can form. The second strategy uses externalstimuli to prevent double layers from reaching equilibrium, thereby effectivelyreducing charge screening. The goal of this article is to describe theserelatively new concepts, and to offer theoretical insights into mechanisms thatmay enable electronic biosensing beyond the double-layer.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success ingraph representation learning. However, expressive power of GNNs is limited bythe 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and thus GNNs generate identicalrepresentations for graph substructures that may in fact be very different.More powerful GNNs, proposed recently by mimicking higher-order-WL tests, onlyfocus on representing entire graphs and they are computationally inefficient asthey cannot utilize sparsity of the underlying graph. Here we propose andmathematically analyze a general class of structure-related features, termedDistance Encoding (DE). DE assists GNNs in representing any set of nodes, whileproviding strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test. DE captures thedistance between the node set whose representation is to be learned and eachnode in the graph. To capture the distance DE can apply various graph-distancemeasures such as shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores. Wepropose two ways for GNNs to use DEs (1) as extra node features, and (2) ascontrollers of message aggregation in GNNs. Both approaches can utilize thesparse structure of the underlying graph, which leads to computationalefficiency and scalability. We also prove that DE can distinguish node setsembedded in almost all regular graphs where traditional GNNs always fail. Weevaluate DE on three tasks over six real networks: structural role prediction,link prediction, and triangle prediction.

However, their number density has not been welldetermined, making it difficult to assess their role in the early ionization ofthe intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we present the updated results ofour $z\sim5$ quasar survey using the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), anear-infrared imaging survey covering an area of 85 deg$^{2}$. From ourspectroscopic observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) onthe Gemini-South 8 m Telescope, we discovered eight new quasars at $z\sim5$with $-26.1\leq M_{1450} \leq -23.3$. Combining our IMS faint quasars($M_{1450}>-27$ mag) with the brighter Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars($M_{1450}<-27$ mag), we derive the $z\sim5$ quasar luminosity function (QLF)without any fixed parameters down to the magnitude limit of $M_{1450}=-23$ mag.We find that the faint-end slope of the QLF is very flat($\alpha=-1.2^{+1.4}_{-0.6}$), with a characteristic luminosity of$M^{*}_{1450}=-25.8^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ mag. The number density of $z\sim5$ quasarsfrom the QLF gives an ionizing emissivity at 912 $\unicode{x212B}$ of$\epsilon_{912}=(3.7$--$7.1)\times10^{23}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$and an ionizing photon density of $\dot{n}_{\rm ion}=(3.0$--$5.7)\times10^{49}$Mpc$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. These results imply that quasars are responsible for only10-20% (up to 50% even in the extreme case) of the photons required tocompletely ionize the IGM at $z\sim5$, disfavoring the idea that quasars alonecould have ionized the IGM at $z\sim5$.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05859,arXiv:2010.05859v1,,,10/12/2020,10/12/2020,,Yongjung Kim; Myungshin Im; Yiseul Jeon; Minjin Kim; Soojong Pak; Minhee Hyun; Yoon Chan Taak; Suhyun Shin; Gu Lim; Gregory S.

However, it has been anoutstanding challenge of how to handle arbitrary first-order logic (FOL)queries as present methods are limited to only a subset of FOL operators. Inparticular, the negation operator is not supported. An additional limitation ofpresent methods is also that they cannot naturally model uncertainty. Here, wepresent BetaE, a probabilistic embedding framework for answering arbitrary FOLqueries over KGs. BetaE is the first method that can handle a complete set offirst-order logical operations: conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$),and negation ($\neg$). A key insight of BetaE is to use probabilisticdistributions with bounded support, specifically the Beta distribution, andembed queries/entities as distributions, which as a consequence allows us toalso faithfully model uncertainty. Logical operations are performed in theembedding space by neural operators over the probabilistic embeddings. Wedemonstrate the performance of BetaE on answering arbitrary FOL queries onthree large, incomplete KGs.

To address this, we present ATOM3D, a collection of bothnovel and existing benchmark datasets spanning several key classes ofbiomolecules. We implement several classes of three-dimensional molecularlearning methods for each of these tasks and show that they consistentlyimprove performance relative to methods based on one- and two-dimensionalrepresentations. The specific choice of architecture proves to be critical forperformance, with three-dimensional convolutional networks excelling at tasksinvolving complex geometries, graph networks performing well on systemsrequiring detailed positional information, and the more recently developedequivariant networks showing significant promise.

However,theoretical studies into how tree-based methods discover Boolean featureinteractions are missing.

Specifically,the LSS model assumes that the regression function is a linear combination ofpiecewise constant Boolean interaction terms.

Here, weinvestigate the use of optical attenuators to extend PCI dynamic range whilemaintaining a near-ideal angular response - critical for accurate measurementswhen UV-C is uncollimated. Through an analytical model, we show that tuningattenuator refractive index, attenuation coefficient, and thickness can extenddynamic range, but compromises ideal angular response unless the attenuator isan ideal diffuser. To demonstrate this tradeoff empirically, we pair PCIs withmodel specular (floated borosilicate) and diffuse (polytetrafluoroethylene)attenuators, characterize the angular response, and evaluate on-N95 UV-C dosemeasurement accuracy of each PCI-attenuator stack in a UV-C decontaminationsystem. While both borosilicate and polytetrafluoroethylene increase PCIdynamic range >4$\times$, both attenuators introduce angle-dependenttransmittance, which causes location-dependent underestimation of UV-C dose.The PCI-borosilicate and PCI-polytetrafluoroethylene stacks underreport trueon-N95 dose by 1) 14.7% and 3.6%, respectively, on a surface near-normal to thearray of source lamps, and 2) 40.8% and 19.8%, respectively, on a steeplysloped location.

Here,we combine data-driven inference with a mechanistic bottom-up approach todevelop a model for protrusion and polarity dynamics in confined cellmigration, revealing how the cellular dynamics adapt to confining geometries.Specifically, we use experimental data of joint protrusion-nucleus migrationtrajectories of cells on confining micropatterns to systematically determine amechanistic model linking the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity,protrusions, and nucleus. This model indicates that the cellular dynamics adaptto confining constrictions through a switch in the polarity dynamics from anegative to a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop. Our model furtherreveals how this feedback loop leads to stereotypical cycles ofprotrusion-nucleus dynamics that drive the migration of the cell throughconstrictions.

We define a 'walkingcilium' as a phenomena where the locomotive force is generated through contactwith a substrate which is periodically reset by steps in the direction ofmotion. We begin by showing that cilia can walk without specialized gaitcontrol and identify the characteristic scales of spatio-temporal heightfluctuations of the tissue. With the addition of surface interaction, weconstruct a low-order dynamical model of this single-cilium sub-unit. Inaddition to studying the dynamics of a single cilium in isolation, wesubsequently examine collections of these walking cilia. En route to anemergent model for ciliary walking, we demonstrate the limits of substratemediated synchronization between cilia. In the desynchronized limit, our modelshows evidence of localized multi-stability mediated by the crosstalk betweenlocomotive forcing and height. The out-of-equilibrium mechanics -- which governthis emergent excitable bistability -- directly control the locomotive forcingof a walking cilia.

Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attentioncapability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memorycomplexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as aconditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate theconditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location canattend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirectattention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations ofembeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attentionpatterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design ofsuch factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$).

In this work, we study deep neural networks designed to harness thestructure in frequency domain for efficient learning of long-range correlationsin space or time: frequency-domain models (FDMs). Existing FDMs are based oncomplex-valued transforms i.e. Fourier Transforms (FT), and layers that performcomputation on the spectrum and input data separately. This design introducesconsiderable computational overhead: for each layer, a forward and inverse FT.Instead, this work introduces a blueprint for frequency domain learning througha single transform: transform once (T1). To enable efficient, direct learningin the frequency domain we derive a variance-preserving weight initializationscheme and investigate methods for frequency selection in reduced-order FDMs.Our results noticeably streamline the design process of FDMs, pruning redundanttransforms, and leading to speedups of 3x to 10x that increase with dataresolution and model size. We perform extensive experiments on learning thesolution operator of spatio-temporal dynamics, including incompressibleNavier-Stokes, turbulent flows around airfoils and high-resolution video ofsmoke.

Using infrared crosslinking immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing (irCLIP-Seq), we show that a subset of mRNAs loses UPF1 binding in ZIKV-infected NPCs, consistent with UPF1's diminished expression.

One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments.

However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested.

Furthermore, interpreting the resulting clustersis difficult, especially when the data is high-dimensional.

In contrast to previous cyclemodeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered inmodeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete andcontinuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data;and they can share information across individuals to model variation bothwithin and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic andreal-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengthsmore accurately than existing methods, with 58% lower error on simulated dataand 63% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performingbaseline.

However,an open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyondsimple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which mightinvolve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, givenan incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict ""em whatdrugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?"" -- aquery that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that {\em might}interact with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficientlymake predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractablesubset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach,we embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operatorsas learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embeddingspace. By performing logical operations within a low-dimensional embeddingspace, our approach achieves a time complexity that is linear in the number ofquery variables, compared to the exponential complexity required by a naiveenumeration-based approach.

We present alarge-scale study of 1.4 million users and weight loss goals, allowing for anunprecedented detailed view of how people set and achieve their goals. We findthat, even for difficult long-term goals, behavior within the first 7 dayspredicts those who ultimately achieve their goals, that is, those who lose atleast as much weight as they set out to, and those who do not. For instance,high amounts of early weight loss, which some researchers have classified asunsustainable, leads to higher goal achievement rates. We also show that earlyfood intake, self-monitoring motivation, and attitude towards the goal areimportant factors.

We find that naive strategies, which pre-train GNNs atthe level of either entire graphs or individual nodes, give limited improvementand can even lead to negative transfer on many downstream tasks.

Yet, understanding what mechanical principlesconstrain these models remains a challenge. Here we provide an empirical studyon 34 proteins supporting the idea that allosteric conformational changegenerally occurs along a soft elastic mode presenting extended regions of highshear. We argue, based on a detailed analysis of how the energy profile alongsuch a mode depends on binding, that in the induced fit scenario there is anoptimal stiffness $k_a^*\sim 1/N$ for cooperative binding, where $N$ is thenumber of residues involved in the allosteric response. We find that thepopulation shift scenario is more robust to mutation affecting stiffness, asbinding becomes more and more cooperative with stiffness up to the samecharacteristic value $k_a^*$, beyond which cooperativity saturates instead ofdecaying. We confirm numerically these findings in a non-linear mechanicalmodel. Dynamical considerations suggest that a stiffness of order $k_a^*$ isfavorable in that scenario as well, supporting that for proper functionproteins must evolve a functional elastic mode that is softer as their sizeincreases.

By removing hidden layers from the target model, using smallerarchitectures, and training for fewer epochs, we create proxies that are anorder of magnitude faster to train.

We evaluate this ""selection via proxy"" (SVP) approach onseveral data selection tasks across five datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet,Amazon Review Polarity, and Amazon Review Full. For active learning, applyingSVP can give an order of magnitude improvement in data selection runtime (i.e.,the time it takes to repeatedly train and select points) without significantlyincreasing the final error (often within 0.1%). For core-set selection onCIFAR10, proxies that are over 10x faster to train than their larger, moreaccurate targets can remove up to 50% of the data without harming the finalaccuracy of the target, leading to a 1.6x end-to-end training time improvement.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11829,arXiv:1906.11829v4,,,06/26/2019,06/26/2019,,Cody Coleman; Christopher Yeh; Stephen Mussmann; Baharan Mirzasoleiman; Peter Bailis; Percy Liang; Jure Leskovec; Matei Zaharia,,,,,,,,,1

The National CancerInstitute (NCI) Workshop on AI in Radiation Oncology (Shady Grove, MD, April4-5, 2019) was the first(https://dctd.cancer.gov/NewsEvents/20190523_ai_in_radiation_oncology.htm) oftwo data science workshops in radiation oncology hosted by the NCI in 2019.During this workshop, the Training and Education Working Group was formed byvolunteers among the invited attendees. Its members represent radiationoncology, medical physics, radiology, computer science, industry, and the NCI.In this perspective article written by members of the Training and EducationWorking Group, we provide and discuss Action Points relevant for futuretrainees interested in radiation oncology AI: (1) creating AI awareness andresponsible conduct; (2) implementing a practical didactic curriculum; (3)creating a publicly available database of training resources; and (4)accelerate learning and funding opportunities. Together, these Action Pointscan facilitate the translation of AI into clinical practice.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13334,arXiv:1910.13334v3,,,10/18/2019,10/18/2019,,John Kang; Reid F.

Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it isunclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the rightamount of curvature.

Recently, a promising approach tothis problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vectorspace such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query.However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, whichis problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set ofits answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as asingle point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that useconjunctions ($\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\exists$). Handlingqueries with logical disjunctions ($\vee$) remains an open problem. Here wepropose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitraryqueries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\exists$ operators in massive andincomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes(i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to aset of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturallyrepresented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result thathandling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional tothe number of KG entities.

In a national election, politicians would like to have persuasivespeakers campaign on their behalf. When a company faces adverse publicity, theywould like to engage persuasive advocates for their position in the presence ofadversaries who are critical of them. Debates represent a common platform forthese forms of adversarial persuasion. This paper solves two problems: theDebate Outcome Prediction (DOP) problem predicts who wins a debate while theIntensity of Persuasion Prediction (IPP) problem predicts the change in thenumber of votes before and after a speaker speaks. Though DOP has beenpreviously studied, we are the first to study IPP. Past studies on DOP fail toleverage two important aspects of multimodal data: 1) multiple modalities areoften semantically aligned, and 2) different modalities may provide diverseinformation for prediction. Our M2P2 (Multimodal Persuasion Prediction)framework is the first to use multimodal (acoustic, visual, language) data tosolve the IPP problem. To leverage the alignment of different modalities whilemaintaining the diversity of the cues they provide, M2P2 devises a noveladaptive fusion learning framework which fuses embeddings obtained from twomodules -- an alignment module that extracts shared information betweenmodalities and a heterogeneity module that learns the weights of differentmodalities with guidance from three separately trained unimodal referencemodels. We test M2P2 on the popular IQ2US dataset designed for DOP. We alsointroduce a new dataset called QPS (from Qipashuo, a popular Chinese debate TVshow ) for IPP.

Underphysiological conditions, the thickness of the resulting electric double layeris less than 1 nm, and it has generally been assumed that electronic detectionbeyond this distance is virtually impossible. However, a few recently-describedsensor design strategies seem to defy this conventional wisdom, exploiting thephysics of electrical double layers in ways that traditional models do notcapture. In the first strategy, charge screening is decreased by constrainingthe space in which double layers can form.

However, expressive power of GNNs is limited bythe 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and thus GNNs generate identicalrepresentations for graph substructures that may in fact be very different.More powerful GNNs, proposed recently by mimicking higher-order-WL tests, onlyfocus on representing entire graphs and they are computationally inefficient asthey cannot utilize sparsity of the underlying graph. Here we propose andmathematically analyze a general class of structure-related features, termedDistance Encoding (DE). DE assists GNNs in representing any set of nodes, whileproviding strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test. DE captures thedistance between the node set whose representation is to be learned and eachnode in the graph. To capture the distance DE can apply various graph-distancemeasures such as shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores. Wepropose two ways for GNNs to use DEs (1) as extra node features, and (2) ascontrollers of message aggregation in GNNs. Both approaches can utilize thesparse structure of the underlying graph, which leads to computationalefficiency and scalability. We also prove that DE can distinguish node setsembedded in almost all regular graphs where traditional GNNs always fail.

This problem is challenging, because KGs can be massive andincomplete. Recent approaches embed KG entities in a low dimensional space andthen use these embeddings to find the answer entities. However, it has been anoutstanding challenge of how to handle arbitrary first-order logic (FOL)queries as present methods are limited to only a subset of FOL operators. Inparticular, the negation operator is not supported. An additional limitation ofpresent methods is also that they cannot naturally model uncertainty. Here, wepresent BetaE, a probabilistic embedding framework for answering arbitrary FOLqueries over KGs. BetaE is the first method that can handle a complete set offirst-order logical operations: conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$),and negation ($\neg$). A key insight of BetaE is to use probabilisticdistributions with bounded support, specifically the Beta distribution, andembed queries/entities as distributions, which as a consequence allows us toalso faithfully model uncertainty. Logical operations are performed in theembedding space by neural operators over the probabilistic embeddings. Wedemonstrate the performance of BetaE on answering arbitrary FOL queries onthree large, incomplete KGs.

In thissimple animal, the manifolds underlying the governing dynamics are shaped andstabilized by a physical mechanism: an active-elastic, inverse-energy cascade.Building upon pioneering work in the field, we explore the formulation of thegoverning dynamics of a polarized active elastic sheet in terms of the normalmodes of an elastic structure decorated by a polarized activity at every node.By incorporating a torque mediated coupling physics, we show that power ispumped from the shortest length scale up to longer length scale modes via acombination of direct mode coupling and preferential dissipation. We use thisresult to motivate the study of organismal locomotion as an emergent simplicitygoverning organism-scale behavior. To master the low dimensional dynamics onthis manifold, we present a zero-transients limit study of the dynamics of +1or vortex-like defects in the ciliary field. We show, experimentally,numerically and analytically that these defects arise from this energy cascadeto generate long-lived, stable modes of locomotive behavior. Using a geometricmodel, we can link defects to organism locomotion. We extend this framework tostudy larger organisms with non-circular shape and introduce local activitymodulation for defect steering.

However, the key limitation of transformers istheir quadratic memory and time complexity $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect tothe sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application inextremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity orlow-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrificeexpressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attentioncapability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memorycomplexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as aconditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate theconditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location canattend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirectattention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations ofembeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attentionpatterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design ofsuch factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-inreplacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easilyimplemented in common frameworks.

Inmammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to andsegregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to thedynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation tomechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinctresponse features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh etal. 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces arenecessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remainunclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine withmanipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. Bysystematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solelyat k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes,but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 $\mu$m lengthscale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preservesk-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles.Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting nearchromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting atpoles.

Pre-operative risk assessments used in clinical practice arelimited in their ability to identify risk for post-operative mortality. Wehypothesize that electrocardiograms contain hidden risk markers that can helpprognosticate post-operative mortality. Methods. In a derivation cohort of45,969 pre-operative patients (age 59+- 19 years, 55 percent women), a deeplearning algorithm was developed to leverage waveform signals frompre-operative ECGs to discriminate post-operative mortality. Model performancewas assessed in a holdout internal test dataset and in two external hospitalcohorts and compared with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score. Results.In the derivation cohort, there were 1,452 deaths. The algorithm discriminatesmortality with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) surpassing the discriminationof the RCRI score with an AUC of 0.67 (CI 0.61-0.72) in the held out testcohort. Patients determined to be high risk by the deep learning model's riskprediction had an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 8.83 (5.57-13.20) forpost-operative mortality as compared to an unadjusted OR of 2.08 (CI 0.77-3.50)for post-operative mortality for RCRI greater than 2. The deep learningalgorithm performed similarly for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with anAUC of 0.85 (CI 0.77-0.92), non-cardiac surgery with an AUC of 0.83(0.79-0.88), and catherization or endoscopy suite procedures with an AUC of0.76 (0.72-0.81). The algorithm similarly discriminated risk for mortality intwo separate external validation cohorts from independent healthcare systemswith AUCs of 0.79 (0.75-0.83) and 0.75 (0.74-0.76) respectively.

Though, while ideal subunit vaccines strongly rely on antigen and adjuvant(s) selection, the mode and timescale of exposure to the immune system has often been overlooked. Unfortunately, poor control over the delivery of many adjuvants, which play a key role in enhancing the quality and potency of immune responses, can limit their efficacy and cause off-target toxicities. There is critical need for new adjuvant delivery technologies to enhance their efficacy and boost vaccine performance. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to be ideal carriers for improving antigen delivery due to their shape and size, which mimic viral structures, but have been generally less explored for adjuvant delivery. Here, we describe the design of self-assembled poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles decorated with CpG, a potent TLR9 agonist, to increase adjuvanticity in COVID-19 vaccines. By controlling the surface density of CpG, we show that intermediate valency is a key factor for TLR9 activation of immune cells. When delivered with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, CpG NP adjuvants greatly improve the magnitude and duration of antibody responses when compared to free CpG, and result in overall greater breadth of immunity against variants of concern. Moreover, encapsulation of CpG NPs into injectable polymeric-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels enhance the spatiotemporal control over co-delivery of CpG NP adjuvant and spike protein antigen such that a single immunization of hydrogel-based vaccines generates comparable humoral responses as a typical prime-boost regimen of soluble vaccines. These delivery technologies can potentially reduce the costs and burden of clinical vaccination, both of which are key elements in fighting a pandemic.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.02.522505,1.0,new results,01/03/2023,01/03/2023,,Ben S.

However, receptor-based cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), face many critical issues including target recognition escape, adverse side effects, and lack of in vivo control. Drug-controllable receptors offer a promising solution to overcome these issues through precise in vivo tuning of cells via enhanced sensing and therapeutic efficacy. Here we develop a novel class of modular and tunable receptors, termed valency-controlled receptors (VCRs), which can leverage customized small molecules to mediate cell signaling strength via controlled spatial clustering. We first develop DNA origami activated VCRs to demonstrate that receptor valency is a core mechanism that modulates immune cell activation. We design a series of customized valency-control ligands (VCLs) by transforming small molecule drugs into a multivalency format and modularly fusing VCR onto the CAR architecture. We demonstrate that VCL induction allows enhanced target sensitivity of engineered cells. Using medicinal chemistry, we develop programmable bioavailable VCL drugs to demonstrate that the VCR system enables drug-induced highly potent responses towards low antigen cancers in vitro and in vivo.

One challengefaced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is thecomplex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic andmicroscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grassplains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problemsanalytically intractable.

However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested.

By not imposing explicit physical constraints,we can flexibly design expressive models while maintaining their computationalefficiency. Physical constraints are implicitly imposed by training the modelsusing physics-based data augmentation. To evaluate the approach, we carefullydesign a scalable and expressive GNN model, ForceNet, and apply it to OC20(Chanussot et al., 2020), an unprecedentedly-large dataset of quantum physicscalculations. Our proposed ForceNet is able to predict atomic forces moreaccurately than state-of-the-art physics-based GNNs while being faster both intraining and inference.

Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine withmanipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. Bysystematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solelyat k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes,but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 $\mu$m lengthscale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preservesk-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles.Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting nearchromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting atpoles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives riseto spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose arekey for function.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04461,arXiv:2204.04461v1,,,04/09/2022,04/09/2022,,Pooja Suresh; Vahe Galstyan; Rob Phillips; Sophie Dumont,,,,,,,Now published in eLife 10.7554/eLife.79558,16.0,1

Pre-operative risk assessments used in clinical practice arelimited in their ability to identify risk for post-operative mortality. Wehypothesize that electrocardiograms contain hidden risk markers that can helpprognosticate post-operative mortality. Methods. In a derivation cohort of45,969 pre-operative patients (age 59+- 19 years, 55 percent women), a deeplearning algorithm was developed to leverage waveform signals frompre-operative ECGs to discriminate post-operative mortality. Model performancewas assessed in a holdout internal test dataset and in two external hospitalcohorts and compared with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score. Results.In the derivation cohort, there were 1,452 deaths. The algorithm discriminatesmortality with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) surpassing the discriminationof the RCRI score with an AUC of 0.67 (CI 0.61-0.72) in the held out testcohort. Patients determined to be high risk by the deep learning model's riskprediction had an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 8.83 (5.57-13.20) forpost-operative mortality as compared to an unadjusted OR of 2.08 (CI 0.77-3.50)for post-operative mortality for RCRI greater than 2. The deep learningalgorithm performed similarly for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with anAUC of 0.85 (CI 0.77-0.92), non-cardiac surgery with an AUC of 0.83(0.79-0.88), and catherization or endoscopy suite procedures with an AUC of0.76 (0.72-0.81). The algorithm similarly discriminated risk for mortality intwo separate external validation cohorts from independent healthcare systemswith AUCs of 0.79 (0.75-0.83) and 0.75 (0.74-0.76) respectively.

In this work, we propose a novel visual questionanswering method, VQA-GNN, which unifies the image-level information andconceptual knowledge to perform joint reasoning of the scene.

But, in spite of their success, inthis paper we identify significant improvements to be made to previousformulations of AO-ARMs. First, we show that AO-ARMs suffer from redundancy intheir probabilistic model, i.e., they define the same distribution in multipledifferent ways. We alleviate this redundancy by training on a smaller set ofunivariate conditionals that still maintains support for efficient arbitraryconditional inference. Second, we upweight the training loss for univariateconditionals that are evaluated more frequently during inference.

Drug-controllable receptors offer a promising solution to overcome these issues through precise in vivo tuning of cells via enhanced sensing and therapeutic efficacy. Here we develop a novel class of modular and tunable receptors, termed valency-controlled receptors (VCRs), which can leverage customized small molecules to mediate cell signaling strength via controlled spatial clustering. We first develop DNA origami activated VCRs to demonstrate that receptor valency is a core mechanism that modulates immune cell activation. We design a series of customized valency-control ligands (VCLs) by transforming small molecule drugs into a multivalency format and modularly fusing VCR onto the CAR architecture. We demonstrate that VCL induction allows enhanced target sensitivity of engineered cells. Using medicinal chemistry, we develop programmable bioavailable VCL drugs to demonstrate that the VCR system enables drug-induced highly potent responses towards low antigen cancers in vitro and in vivo.

In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1.0,new results,01/07/2023,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.

With over 44,000 nuclei and 6,000 cells analyzed, the data provide identification of rare cell types, mapping of intermediate steps in differentiation, and the potential to identify new factors impacting fertility or controlling differentiation of germline and supporting somatic cells. We justify assignment of key germline and somatic cell types using combinations of known markers, in situ hybridization, and analysis of extant protein traps. Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation.

Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.06.522937,1.0,new results,01/07/2023,01/07/2023,,Michael Alexanian; Arun Padmanabhan; Tomohiro Nishino; Joshua G.

We showed that the LC3-interacting region (LIR) docking site (LDS), the major interaction interface of the Atg8 protein family, is required for P. falciparum Atg8 (",Atg8; Plasmodium; Toxoplasma; apicomplexan parasites; apicoplast; malaria; nonautophagic function of Atg8,,,,,01/11/2023,2023/01/10,2023/1/11,Marta Walczak; Thomas R Meister; Hoa Mai Nguyen; Yili Zhu; Sébastien Besteiro; Ellen Yeh,,"Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.; LPHI UMR5235, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France.","Marta Walczak: Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Thomas R Meister: Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Hoa Mai Nguyen: LPHI UMR5235, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France.Yili Zhu: Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Sébastien Besteiro: LPHI UMR5235, University of Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France.Ellen Yeh: Department of Pathology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California, USA.",,,,,,1

We sought new inhibitors of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) activity of Nsp14 with three large library docking strategies. First, up to 1.1 billion make-on-demand (tangible) lead-like molecules were docked against the enzyme SAM site, seeking reversible inhibitors. On de novo synthesis and testing, three inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 43 M, each with novel chemotypes. Structure-guided optimization and in vitro characterization supported their non-covalent mechanism. In a second strategy, docking a library of 16 million tangible fragments revealed nine new inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 341 M and ligand efficiencies from 0.29 to 0.42. In a third strategy, a newly created library of 25 million tangible, virtual electrophiles were docked to covalently modify Cys387 in the SAM binding site. Seven inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 3.2 to 39 M, the most potent being a reversible aldehyde. Initial optimization of a second series yielded a 7 M acrylamide inhibitor. Three inhibitors characteristic of the new series were tested for selectivity against 30 human protein and RNA MTases, with one showing partial selectivity and one showing high selectivity. Overall, 32 inhibitors encompassing eleven chemotypes had IC50 values <50 M and 5 inhibitors in four chemotypes had IC50 values <10 M. These molecules are among the first non-SAM-like inhibitors of Nsp14, providing multiple starting points for optimizing towards antiviral activity.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.12.523677,1.0,new results,01/13/2023,01/13/2023,,Isha Singh; Fengling Li; Elissa Fink; Irene Chau; Alice Li; Annia Rodriguez-Hernandez; Isabella Glenn; Francisco J Zapatero-Belinchon; Mario Rodriguez; Kanchan Devkota; Zhijie Deng; Kris White; Xiaobo Wan; Nataliya A Tolmachova; Yurii S Moroz; H.

The discovery of conserved genes in viruses infecting geographically and phylogenetically diverse hosts has provided important evolutionary context for human and animal pathogens. However, the resulting viral genomes are often incomplete, and analyses largely characterize the distribution of viruses over their dynamics. Here, we show how the accumulated data of metagenomicstudies can be integrated to reveal geographic and evolutionary dynamics in a case study of Orthomyxoviridae, the family of RNA viruses containing influenza. First, we use sequences of the orthomyxovirus Wuhan mosquito virus 6 to track the global migrations of its host. We then look at overall orthomyxovirus genome evolution, finding significant gene gain and loss across the family, especially in the surface proteins responsible for cell and host tropism. We find that the surface protein of Wuhan mosquito virus 6 exhibits accelerated non-synonymous evolution suggestive of antigenic evolution, and an entire quaranjavirus group bearing highly diverged surface proteins. Finally we quantify the progress of orthomyxovirus discovery and forecast that many highly diverged Orthomyxoviridae remain to be found. We argue that continued metagenomic studies will be fruitful for understanding the dynamics, evolution, ecology of viruses and their hosts, regardless of whether novel species are actually identified or not, as long as study designs allowing for the resolution of complete viral genomes are employed.",,,biorxiv;2022.08.31.505987,2.0,new results,2022-10-04 00:00:00,10/04/2022,,Gytis Dudas; Joshua Batson,"Dudas, G.; Batson, J.","Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub","Gytis Dudas, Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Centre at Vilnius University], [Joshua Batson, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub",,,,,,0

Using the antibody sequences of B cells, we tracked clones during in vitro differentiation. Clonal analysis revealed a subset of IgM+ B cells which were more proliferative than other B-cell types. Whereas the population of B cells adopted diverse states during differentiation, clones had a restricted set of fates available to them; there were two times more single-fate clones than expected given population-level cell-type diversity. This implicated a molecular memory of initial cell states that was propagated through differentiation. We then identified the genes which had strongest coherence within clones. These genes significantly overlapped known B-cell fate determination programs, suggesting the genes which determine cell identity are most robustly controlled on a clonal level. Persistent clonal identities were also observed in human plasma cells from bone marrow, indicating that these transcriptional programs maintain long-term cell identities in vivo.

We sought new inhibitors of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) activity of Nsp14 with three large library docking strategies. First, up to 1.1 billion make-on-demand (tangible) lead-like molecules were docked against the enzyme SAM site, seeking reversible inhibitors. On de novo synthesis and testing, three inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 43 M, each with novel chemotypes. Structure-guided optimization and in vitro characterization supported their non-covalent mechanism. In a second strategy, docking a library of 16 million tangible fragments revealed nine new inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 12 to 341 M and ligand efficiencies from 0.29 to 0.42. In a third strategy, a newly created library of 25 million tangible, virtual electrophiles were docked to covalently modify Cys387 in the SAM binding site. Seven inhibitors emerged with IC50 values ranging from 3.2 to 39 M, the most potent being a reversible aldehyde. Initial optimization of a second series yielded a 7 M acrylamide inhibitor. Three inhibitors characteristic of the new series were tested for selectivity against 30 human protein and RNA MTases, with one showing partial selectivity and one showing high selectivity. Overall, 32 inhibitors encompassing eleven chemotypes had IC50 values <50 M and 5 inhibitors in four chemotypes had IC50 values <10 M.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis.

We describe a method forphenotype recognition that imputes phenotype codes for all UK Biobankparticipants. Materials and Methods POPDx (Population-based ObjectivePhenotyping by Deep Extrapolation) is a bilinear machine learning framework forsimultaneously estimating the probabilities of 1,538 phenotype codes. Weextracted phenotypic and health-related information of 392,246 individuals fromthe UK Biobank for POPDx development and evaluation. A total of 12,803 ICD-10diagnosis codes of the patients were converted to 1,538 Phecodes as goldstandard labels. The POPDx framework was evaluated and compared to otheravailable methods on automated multi-phenotype recognition. Results POPDx canpredict phenotypes that are rare or even unobserved in training. We demonstratesubstantial improvement of automated multi-phenotype recognition across 22disease categories, and its application in identifying key epidemiologicalfeatures associated with each phenotype.

Here, we use thousands of microbial communities cultured in vitro from human feces to uncover simple assembly rules and develop a predictive model of community composition upon addition of single nutrients from central carbon metabolism to a complex medium. Community membership was largely determined by the donor feces, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient, due to the ability of fast-growing organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities.

Microsporidia use an unusual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 1/sec. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations.

To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, which can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis. We further show that the magnitude of inhibition depends on the cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most mouse and human cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL DE droplets with fluorescence quantifiable via FACS. These results open up new avenues for improving picoscale droplet RT-PCR reactions and expanding microfluidic droplet-based single-cell analysis technologies.",,,,,,01/05/2023,2023/01/04,2023/1/5,Margarita Khariton; Conor J McClune; Kara K Brower; Sandy Klemm; Elizabeth S Sattely; Polly M Fordyce; Bo Wang,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94110, United States.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.","Margarita Khariton: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Conor J McClune: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Kara K Brower: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Sandy Klemm: Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Elizabeth S Sattely: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.Polly M Fordyce: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; ChEM-H Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, California94110, United States.Bo Wang: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California94305, United States.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.08.16.504154,20.0,1

Output plots give information on the quality control of the screen data (e.g., sgRNA distribution) and show the best hits by aggregation from multiple screen experiments. To maximize comparability, rank is used to identify common hits. MaGplotR can also be used to analyze experiments where a control condition is used for multiple treatment conditions. MaGplotR is easy to use, with even just one argument.

Microsporidia use an unusual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 1/sec. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.17.524456,1.0,new results,01/18/2023,01/18/2023,,Ray Chang; Ari Davydov; Pattana Jaroenlak; Breane Budaitis; Damian C.

Using sequence homology and computational modeling, we identify four sites that can accommodate insertion of a polyhistidine tag and demonstrate purification of both hemagglutinin-modified and SARS-CoV-2 spike-modified ferritins, highlighting the generality of the approach. A site at the 4-fold axis of symmetry enables optimal purification of both protein nanoparticles. We demonstrate improved purification through modulating the polyhistidine length and optimizing both the metal cation and the resin type.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) allows sorting droplets with commercially available fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream analyses. However, sorting DE droplets with standard cytometers requires small droplets that can pass FACS nozzles. This poses challenges for molecular biology, as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition.

In a study of iron supplementation in healthy humans, we identified gradual microbiota shifts in some participants correlated with bacterial iron internalization. To identify direct effects due to taxon-specific iron sensitivity, we used participant stool samples to derive diverse in vitro communities. Iron supplementation of these communities caused small compositional shifts, mimicking those in vivo, whereas iron deprivation dramatically inhibited growth with irreversible, cumulative reduction in diversity and replacement of dominant species. Sensitivity of individual species to iron deprivation in axenic culture generally predicted iron dependency in a community.

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.

Statement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation across archaeal ribosomes in the peptidyl transferase center that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,,,,01/21/2023,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Amos J Nissley; Petar I Penev; Zoe L Watson; Jillian F Banfield; Jamie H D Cate,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Amos J Nissley: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Petar I Penev: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Zoe L Watson: California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jamie H D Cate: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,23.0,0

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway.

Iron supplementation of these communities caused small compositional shifts, mimicking those in vivo, whereas iron deprivation dramatically inhibited growth with irreversible, cumulative reduction in diversity and replacement of dominant species. Sensitivity of individual species to iron deprivation in axenic culture generally predicted iron dependency in a community.

Microsporidia use an un-usual invasion organelle called the polar tube (PT), which is ejected from a dormant spore at ultra-fast speeds, to infect host cells. The mechanics of PT ejection are impressive. Anncaliia algerae microsporidia spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a 100-nm-wide PT at a speed of 300 m/sec, creating a shear rate of 3000 sec-1. The infectious cargo, which contains two nuclei, is shot through this narrow tube for a distance of ~60-140 m 1 and into the host cell. Considering the large hydraulic resistance in an extremely thin tube and the low-Reynolds-number nature of the process, it is not known how microsporidia can achieve this ultrafast event. In this study, we use Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy to capture 3-dimensional snapshots of A. algerae spores in different states of the PT ejection process. Grounded in these data, we propose a theoretical framework starting with a systematic exploration of possible topological connectivity amongst organelles, and assess the energy requirements of the resulting models. We perform PT firing experiments in media of varying viscosity, and use the results to rank our proposed hypotheses based on their predicted energy requirement, pressure and power. We also present a possible mechanism for cargo translocation, and quantitatively compare our predictions to experimental observations. Our study provides a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the energy dissipation of microsporidian infection process and demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics.

Statement of SignificanceMicrosporidia are a group of spore-forming, intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts (including humans). Once triggered, microsporidian spores (3-4 m in size) shoot out a specialized organelle called the polar tube (PT) (60-140 m long, 100 nm wide) at ultrafast speed (300 m/sec), penetrating host cells and acting as a conduit for the transport of infectious cargo. Although this process has fascinated biologists for a century, the biophysical mechanisms underlying PT extrusion are not understood. We thus take a data-driven approach to generate models for the physical basis of PT firing and cargo transport through the PT. Our approach here demonstrates the extreme limits of cellular hydraulics and the potential applications of biophysical approaches to other cellular architectures.

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center.

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway.

However, surveillance mechanisms that specifically respond to stalled ribosomes with an occluded A site have not been identified. We discovered that the elongation factor-1α (eEF1A) inhibitor, ternatin-4, triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of eEF1A on stalled ribosomes. Using a chemical genetic approach, we unveiled a signaling network comprising two E3 ligases, RNF14 and RNF25, which are required for eEF1A degradation. Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role by engaging RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates eEF1A. The site-specific, RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein RPS27A/eS31 provides a second essential signaling input.

Here, we image dopamine modulation in striatal brain tissue slices with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCat) and implement machine learning to determine which features of dopamine modulation are unique to changes in stimulation strength, and to different neuroanatomical regions. We trained a support vector machine and a random forest classifier to determine whether recordings were made from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) versus the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and find that machine learning is able to accurately distinguish dopamine release that occurs in DLS from that occurring in DMS in a manner unachievable with canonical statistical analysis. Furthermore, our analysis determines that dopamine modulatory signals including the number of unique dopamine release sites and peak dopamine released per stimulation event are most predictive of neuroanatomy yet note that integrated neuromodulator amount is the conventional metric currently used to monitor neuromodulation in animal studies. Lastly, our study finds that machine learning discrimination of different stimulation strengths or neuroanatomical regions is only possible in adult animals, suggesting a high degree of variability in dopamine modulatory kinetics during animal development.

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center.

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway.

Using a chemical genetic approach, we unveiled a signaling network comprising two E3 ligases, RNF14 and RNF25, which are required for eEF1A degradation. Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role by engaging RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates eEF1A.

Here, we image dopamine modulation in striatal brain tissue slices with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCat) and implement machine learning to determine which features of dopamine modulation are unique to changes in stimulation strength, and to different neuroanatomical regions. We trained a support vector machine and a random forest classifier to determine whether recordings were made from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) versus the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and find that machine learning is able to accurately distinguish dopamine release that occurs in DLS from that occurring in DMS in a manner unachievable with canonical statistical analysis. Furthermore, our analysis determines that dopamine modulatory signals including the number of unique dopamine release sites and peak dopamine released per stimulation event are most predictive of neuroanatomy yet note that integrated neuromodulator amount is the conventional metric currently used to monitor neuromodulation in animal studies. Lastly, our study finds that machine learning discrimination of different stimulation strengths or neuroanatomical regions is only possible in adult animals, suggesting a high degree of variability in dopamine modulatory kinetics during animal development.

Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli (Eco) genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Eco with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis.

Ribosomes are capable of functioning across this wide range of temperatures even though the catalytic site for peptide bond formation, the peptidyl transferase center, is nearly universally conserved. Here we find that Thermoproteota, a phylum of thermophilic Archaea, substitute cytidine for uridine at large subunit rRNA positions 2554 and 2555 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the A loop, immediately adjacent to the binding site for the 3'-end of A-site tRNA. We show by cryo-EM that E. coli ribosomes with uridine to cytidine mutations at these positions retain the proper fold and post-transcriptional modification of the A loop. Additionally, these mutations do not affect cellular growth, protect the large ribosomal subunit from thermal denaturation, and increase the mutational robustness of nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center. This work identifies sequence variation across archaeal ribosomes in the peptidyl transferase center that likely confers stabilization of the ribosome at high temperatures and develops a stable mutant bacterial ribosome that can act as a scaffold for future ribosome engineering efforts.",,,,,,01/21/2023,2023/01/20,2023/1/21,Amos J Nissley; Petar I Penev; Zoe L Watson; Jillian F Banfield; Jamie H D Cate,,"California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.","Amos J Nissley: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Petar I Penev: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Zoe L Watson: California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jillian F Banfield: Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Jamie H D Cate: Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.; Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.07.15.499945,23.0,1

Here we demonstrate that TurboID-based proximity labeling (TbPL) effectively and specifically captures the substrates of kinases and phosphatases. TbPL-mass spectrometry (TbPL-MS) identified over four hundred proximal proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2), a member of the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3) family that integrates signaling pathways controlling diverse developmental and acclimation processes. A large portion of the BIN2 proximal proteins showed BIN2-dependent phosphorylation in vivo or in vitro, suggesting that these are BIN2 substrates. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the BIN2 proximal proteins include interactors of BIN2 substrates, revealing a high level of interactions among the BIN2 proximal proteins. Our proteomic analysis establishes the BIN2 signaling network and uncovers BIN2 functions in regulating key cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, translation initiation, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization. We further discovered significant overlap between the GSK3 phosphorylome and the O-GlcNAcylome, suggesting an evolutionarily ancient relationship between GSK3 and the nutrient-sensing O-glycosylation pathway.

Here, we image dopamine modulation in striatal brain tissue slices with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCat) and implement machine learning to determine which features of dopamine modulation are unique to changes in stimulation strength, and to different neuroanatomical regions. We trained a support vector machine and a random forest classifier to determine whether recordings were made from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) versus the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and find that machine learning is able to accurately distinguish dopamine release that occurs in DLS from that occurring in DMS in a manner unachievable with canonical statistical analysis. Furthermore, our analysis determines that dopamine modulatory signals including the number of unique dopamine release sites and peak dopamine released per stimulation event are most predictive of neuroanatomy yet note that integrated neuromodulator amount is the conventional metric currently used to monitor neuromodulation in animal studies. Lastly, our study finds that machine learning discrimination of different stimulation strengths or neuroanatomical regions is only possible in adult animals, suggesting a high degree of variability in dopamine modulatory kinetics during animal development. Our study highlights that machine learning could become a broadly-utilized tool to differentiate between neuroanatomical regions, or between neurotypical and disease states, with features not detectable by conventional statistical analysis.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.17.524454,1.0,new results,01/20/2023,01/20/2023,,Siamak K.

Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli (Eco) genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Eco with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis. Together, our study highlights the consequences of co-regulating essential pathways on recipient fitness during interbacterial competition, and how antibacterial toxins leverage cellular vulnerabilities that are both direct and indirect to their specific targets in vivo.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.20.524922,2.0,new results,01/23/2023,01/23/2023,,Kristine L Trotta; Beth M Hayes; Johannes P Schneider; Jing Wang; Horia Todor; Patrick Rockefeller Grimes; Ziyi Zhao; William Hatleberg; Melanie R Silvis; Rachel Kim; Byoung-Mo Koo; Marek Basler; Seemay Chou,"Trotta, K.

Despite the conserved nature of these targets, T6SS potency can vary across recipient species. To understand the molecular basis of intrinsic T6SS susceptibility, we screened for essential Escherichia coli (Eco) genes that affect its survival when antagonized by a cell wall-degrading T6SS toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tae1. We revealed genes associated with both the cell wall and a separate layer of the cell envelope, surface lipopolysaccharide, that modulate Tae1 toxicity in vivo. Disruption of lipopolysaccharide synthesis provided Eco with novel resistance to Tae1, despite significant cell wall degradation. These data suggest that Tae1 toxicity is determined not only by direct substrate damage, but also by indirect cell envelope homeostasis activities. We also found that Tae1-resistant Eco exhibited reduced cell wall synthesis and overall slowed growth, suggesting that reactive cell envelope maintenance pathways could promote, not prevent, self-lysis. Together, our study highlights the consequences of co-regulating essential pathways on recipient fitness during interbacterial competition, and how antibacterial toxins leverage cellular vulnerabilities that are both direct and indirect to their specific targets in vivo.",,,biorxiv;2023.01.20.524922,2.0,new results,01/23/2023,01/23/2023,,Kristine L Trotta; Beth M Hayes; Johannes P Schneider; Jing Wang; Horia Todor; Patrick Rockefeller Grimes; Ziyi Zhao; William Hatleberg; Melanie R Silvis; Rachel Kim; Byoung-Mo Koo; Marek Basler; Seemay Chou,"Trotta, K.

Vedolizumab (VDZ) is an anti-integrin monoclonal antibody that is effective for treating UC. VDZ is thought to primarily inhibit lymphocyte trafficking to the intestine, but its effect on other cell subsets is less well characterized. To identify the inflammatory cells that contribute to colitis and respond to VDZ, we performed a single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of peripheral blood and colonic biopsies in healthy controls (HC) and patients with UC on either aminosalicylates or VDZ. We identified mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as a primary target of VDZ, with comparatively modest effects on lymphocytes. Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics demonstrated increased density and proximity of MNP and fibroblast subsets in UC biopsies when compared to HC, with inhibition by VDZ.

Diet, in particular the microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fiber, is one of the most powerful ways to affect the composition and metabolic output of the gut microbiome. As such, diet is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of C. difficile and for developing alternative approaches for coping with this pathogen. One prominent class of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome is short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic end products of MAC metabolism. SCFAs are known to decrease the fitness of C. difficile ",bacterial pathogenesis; microbial metabolites; microbiome; microbiota,,,,,01/25/2023,2023/01/24,2023/1/25,Daniel A Pensinger; Andrea T Fisher; Horia A Dobrila; William Van Treuren; Jackson O Gardner; Steven K Higginbottom; Matthew M Carter; Benjamin Schumann; Carolyn R Bertozzi; Victoria Anikst; Cody Martin; Elizabeth V Robilotti; Jo May Chow; Rachael H Buck; Lucy S Tompkins; Justin L Sonnenburg; Andrew J Hryckowian,,"Abbott, Nutrition Division, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.","Daniel A Pensinger: Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.Andrea T Fisher: Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Horia A Dobrila: Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.William Van Treuren: Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Jackson O Gardner: Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Steven K Higginbottom: Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Matthew M Carter: Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Benjamin Schumann: Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.Carolyn R Bertozzi: Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.Victoria Anikst: Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Cody Martin: Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.Elizabeth V Robilotti: Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Jo May Chow: Abbott, Nutrition Division, Columbus, Ohio, USA.Rachael H Buck: Abbott, Nutrition Division, Columbus, Ohio, USA.Lucy S Tompkins: Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.Justin L Sonnenburg: Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, San Francisco, California, USA.Andrew J Hryckowian: Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.",,,,,,0
