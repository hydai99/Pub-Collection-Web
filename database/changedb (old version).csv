This finding led to the development of CRISPR systems that harness natural DNA repair mechanisms to repair deficient genes more easily and precisely than ever before. CRISPR has been used to knock out harmful mutant genes and to fix errors in coding sequences to rescue disease phenotypes in preclinical studies and in several clinical trials. However, most genetic disorders result from combinations of mutations, deletions and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome and therefore require sophisticated genome engineering strategies beyond simple gene knockout. To overcome this limitation, the toolbox of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas systems has been dramatically expanded to include diverse tools that function in human cells for precise genome editing and epigenome engineering. The application of CRISPR technology to edit the non-coding genome, modulate gene regulation, make precise genetic changes and target infectious diseases has the potential to lead to curative therapies for many previously untreatable diseases.",,,,,,2022-10-26 00:00:00,2022/10/24,2022/10/26,Michael Chavez; Xinyi Chen; Paul B Finn; Lei S Qi,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.","Michael Chavez: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Xinyi Chen: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Paul B Finn: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Lei S Qi: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Sarafan ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA. stanley.qi@stanford.edu.",,,,,,0

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single-cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both the liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization. Our work highlights the power and necessity of type-specific neuronal access and time-lapse imaging in identifying wiring mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of functional neural maps.",,,biorxiv;2022.12.28.522173,1.0,new results,12/29/2022,12/29/2022,,Kenneth Kin Lam Wong; Tongchao Li; Tian-Ming Fu; Gaoxiang Liu; Cheng Lyu; Sayeh Kohani; Qijing Xie; David J Luginbuhl; Srigokul Upadhyayula; Eric Betzig; Liqun Luo,"Wong, K.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

Imaging-based spatial technologies such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) can achieve single-cell resolution, directly mapping single-cell identities to spatial positions. MERFISH produces a different data type than scRNA-seq, and a technical comparison between the two modalities is necessary to ascertain how to best integrate them. We performed MERFISH on the mouse liver and kidney and compared the resulting bulk and single-cell RNA statistics with those from the Tabula Muris Senis cell atlas and from two Visium datasets. MERFISH quantitatively reproduced the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq results with improvements in overall dropout rates and sensitivity. Finally, we found that MERFISH independently resolved distinct cell types and spatial structure in both the liver and kidney. Computational integration with the Tabula Muris Senis atlas did not enhance these results.

We find that while mammals resemble one another in total TE content and diversity, they show substantial differences with regard to recent TE accumulation. This includes multiple recent expansion and quiescence events across the mammalian tree. Young TEs, particularly LINEs, drive increases in genome size while DNA transposons are associated with smaller genomes. Mammals tend to accumulate only a few types of TE at any given time, with one TE type dominating. We also found association between dietary habit and the presence of DNA transposon invasions. These detailed annotations will serve as a benchmark for future comparative TE analyses among placental mammals.

Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.",,,,,,06/17/2022,,2022/6/17,Caleigh Mandel-Brehm; Sara E Vazquez; Christopher Liverman; Mickie Cheng; Zoe Quandt; Andrew F Kung; Audrey Parent; Brenda Miao; Emmanuel Disse; Christine Cugnet-Anceau; Stéphane Dalle; Elizaveta Orlova; Elena Frolova; Diana Alba; Aaron Michels; Bergithe E Oftedal; Michail S Lionakis; Eystein S Husebye; Anil K Agarwal; Xilong Li; Chengsong Zhu; Quan Li; Elif Oral; Rebecca Brown; Mark S Anderson; Abhimanyu Garg; Joseph L DeRisi,,"Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.; Department of Immunology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Science and K.G.

We conclude that MERFISH provides a quantitatively comparable method for single-cell gene expression and can identify cell types without the need for computational integration with scRNA-seq atlases.",,,,,,12/17/2022,2022/12/16,2022/12/17,Jonathan Liu; Vanessa Tran; Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri; Ashley Byrne; Michael Borja; Yang Joon Kim; Snigdha Agarwal; Ruofan Wang; Kyle Awayan; Abhishek Murti; Aris Taychameekiatchai; Bruce Wang; George Emanuel; Jiang He; John Haliburton; Angela Oliveira Pisco; Norma F Neff,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA norma.neff@czbiohub.org.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.; School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Vizgen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.","Jonathan Liu: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Vanessa Tran: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Venkata Naga Pranathi Vemuri: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Ashley Byrne: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Michael Borja: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Yang Joon Kim: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Snigdha Agarwal: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Ruofan Wang: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Kyle Awayan: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Abhishek Murti: School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.Aris Taychameekiatchai: School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.Bruce Wang: School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.George Emanuel: Vizgen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.Jiang He: Vizgen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.John Haliburton: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Angela Oliveira Pisco: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.Norma F Neff: Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA norma.neff@czbiohub.org.",,,,bioRxiv 10.1101/2022.03.04.483068,16.0,1
