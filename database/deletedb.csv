Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) previously described target the native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Envelope (Env), but the relevance of the tiered categories for inhibitors targeting another Env conformation, the pre-hairpin intermediate, is not well understood. Here we show that two inhibitors targeting distinct highly-conserved regions of the pre-hairpin intermediate have strikingly consistent neutralization potencies (within [~]100-fold for a given inhibitor) against strains in all three neutralization tiers of HIV-1; in contrast, best-in-class bnAbs targeting diverse Env epitopes vary by more than 10,000-fold in potency against these strains. Our results indicate that antisera-based HIV-1 neutralization tiers are not relevant for inhibitors targeting the pre-hairpin intermediate and highlight the potential for therapies and vaccine efforts targeting this conformation.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.06.511062,1.0,new results,01/07/2022,01/07/2022,,"Bell, B.

Evidence on CVD risk factor prevalence among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty globally is sparse because studies have used measures of socioeconomic status that are not comparable across study populations and countries. For adults living in extreme poverty, this study aimed to determine i) the prevalence of each of five key CVD risk factors, ii) how the prevalence of these CVD risk factors varies across and within countries, and iii) the level of treatment coverage with statin, antihypertensive, and diabetes therapy.

MethodsWe pooled individual-level data from 105 nationally representative household surveys with physical measurements of hypertension, diabetes, overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as self-reported smoking status, from 78 countries that represent 85% of people living in extreme poverty globally. Those living in extreme poverty were defined by ordering participants according to a continuous household wealth index or household income value, and then applying World Bank estimates on the proportion of each countrys population that is living in extreme poverty. We used modified Poisson regression models to examine how CVD risk factor prevalence among those in extreme poverty varied by age, sex, educational attainment, and rural versus urban residency. We also calculated the proportion of participants with diabetes or hypertension who self-reported the use of blood pressure- or blood glucose-lowering medication, respectively; the proportion with hypertension who achieved blood pressure control; and the proportion recommended for statin use according to WHO guidelines who reported taking a statin.

ResultsOf 32,695,579 participants, 7,922,289 were living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), 15,986,099 on less than $3.20/day, and 23,466,879 on less than $5.50/day. Among those living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), the age-standardized prevalence was 17.5% (95% CI: 16.7% - 18.3%) for hypertension, 4.0% (95% CI: 3.6% - 4.5%) for diabetes, 10.6% (95% CI: 9.0% - 12.3%) for current smoking, 3.1% (95% CI: 2.8% - 3.3%) for obesity, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9% - 1.9%) for dyslipidemia. In most countries in our analysis, the prevalence of these risk factors among those living in extreme poverty was not notably lower than in the total population. Hypertension treatment and control, diabetes treatment, and statin use were low across all poverty levels in low-income countries, while in lower and upper middle-income countries individuals living at more extreme levels of poverty had a lower probability of reporting the use of these medications and achieving hypertension control.

ConclusionsWe found a high prevalence of CVD risk factors among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty, along with low statin use and low treatment rates for diabetes and hypertension. Our detailed analysis and comparison across poverty levels could inform equity discussions for resource allocation and the design of effective interventions.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280861,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/10/2022,01/10/2022,,"Geldsetzer, P.; Tisdale, R.

Using proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, we identified Numb as a new ciliary protein that positively regulates Hh signaling. Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket and acts as an endocytic adaptor to incorporate Ptch1 into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby promoting Ptch1 exit from the cilium, a key step in Hh signaling activation. Numb loss impaired Sonic Hedgehog-induced Ptch1 departure from the cilium, resulting in severe attenuation of Hh signaling. Genetic ablation of Numb and its homolog Numblike in the developing cerebellum impaired the proliferation of granule cell precursors, a Hh-dependent process, resulting in reduced cerebellar size. This study demonstrates a key function of Numb in controlling protein levels in the cilium, and highlights Numbs critical role in the regulation of Hh signaling.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.10.511655,3.0,new results,01/11/2022,01/11/2022,,"Liu, X.; Yam, P.; Chen, W.-J.; Schlienger, S.; Torres Gutierrez, O.; Cai, E.; Zhang, J.; Ting, A.

We term this strategy, integrating cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) with glycoprotein surface capture, ""structural surfaceomics"". As a proof of principle, we apply this technology to acute myeloid leukemia, a hematologic malignancy with dismal outcomes and no known optimal immunotherapy target. We identify the activated conformation of integrin-{beta}2 as a structurally-defined, widely-expressed, AML-specific target.

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes.

Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 15 human organ donors, 20 tissues, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the healthy human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution. In order to construct this atlas, we developed a computational pipeline which identifies high-confidence microbial sequences from three domains of life within the sea of human transcripts in individual cells, and show that this is a non-trivial search for one in a million sequences. Together with data from a separate validation cohort of 8 additional donors, we identify more than a thousand diverse bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. In characterizing the human tissue microbiome, we demonstrate that individuals harbor unique species associated not just with each tissue but often with particular cell types, and that many of these species remain uncharacterized. Moreover, combining our data with the Human Microbiome Project, the tumor microbiome dataset by Nejman et al., and the PATRIC database, we map the likely microbial flow routes from external-facing microbiomes to internal tissues and tumors, and show the existence of many unexpected routes taken by both commensals and pathogens. We find that [~]30% of bacterial species found in tumors are detectable across healthy tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from healthy tissues, even those from distant sites. Increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantify the microbial load and diversity across different cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells.

We used sensitivity analyses and bias analyses to explore such discrepancies in a study of the indirect effects of influenza vaccination.

MethodsWe fit an age-structured, deterministic, compartmental model to estimate indirect effects of a school-based influenza vaccination program in California that was evaluated in a previous matched cohort study. To understand discrepancies in their results, we used 1) a model with constrained parameters such that projections matched the cohort study; and 2) probabilistic bias analyses to identify potential biases (e.g., outcome misclassification due to incomplete influenza testing) that, if corrected, would align the empirical results with the mathematical model.

ResultsThe indirect effect estimate (% reduction in influenza hospitalization among older adults in intervention vs. control) was 22.3% (95% CI 7.6% - 37.1%) in the cohort study but only 1.6% (95% Bayesian credible intervals 0.4 - 4.4%) in the mathematical model. When constrained, mathematical models aligned with the cohort study when there was substantially lower pre-existing immunity among school-age children and older adults. Conversely, empirical estimates corrected for potential bias aligned with mathematical model estimates only if influenza testing rates were 15-23% lower in the intervention vs. comparison site.

ConclusionsSensitivity and bias analysis can shed light on why results of mathematical models and empirical epidemiologic studies differ for the same research question, and in turn, can improve study and model design.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280870,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/13/2022,01/13/2022,,"Arinaminpathy, N.; Reed, C.; Biggerstaff, M.; Nguyen, A.; Athni, T.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",,,biorxiv;2021.07.01.450475,2.0,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,"Wang, C.; Dinesh, R.; Qu, Y.; Rustagi, A.; Cousins, H.; Zengel, J.; Zhang, T.; Magazine, N.; Guo, Y.; Hall, T.; Beck, A.; Heilbroner, L.; Peters-Schulze, G.; Wilk, A.; Tso, L.; Erdemic, E.; Tanudtanud, K.; Ren, S.; Tzeng, K.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in agin, but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell specific Hmgcl deficient mice fed a high-fat diet.

We therefore sought to test if the effects of cell size on protein concentrations were also evident in single cell proteomics data. Using the relative concentrations of histone proteins to estimate a cells DNA-to-cell volume ratio, we found that cell size correlated with the cell-to-cell variance in two single cell proteome datasets, each acquired using different preparation and measurement platforms. Moreover, the proteome differences between small and large single cells significantly correlated with how cell size affects the proteomes of cultured cells measured in bulk.

Recent advances in genetic analysis of the erythroid lineage using small-hairpin RNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) in red-blood cells derived from stem cells have generated new insights into the functions of several candidate host factors for Plasmodium parasites.

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction.

HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice.

Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) previously described target the native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Envelope (Env), but the relevance of the tiered categories for inhibitors targeting another Env conformation, the pre-hairpin intermediate, is not well understood. Here we show that two inhibitors targeting distinct highly-conserved regions of the pre-hairpin intermediate have strikingly consistent neutralization potencies (within [~]100-fold for a given inhibitor) against strains in all three neutralization tiers of HIV-1; in contrast, best-in-class bnAbs targeting diverse Env epitopes vary by more than 10,000-fold in potency against these strains.

Evidence on CVD risk factor prevalence among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty globally is sparse because studies have used measures of socioeconomic status that are not comparable across study populations and countries. For adults living in extreme poverty, this study aimed to determine i) the prevalence of each of five key CVD risk factors, ii) how the prevalence of these CVD risk factors varies across and within countries, and iii) the level of treatment coverage with statin, antihypertensive, and diabetes therapy.

MethodsWe pooled individual-level data from 105 nationally representative household surveys with physical measurements of hypertension, diabetes, overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as self-reported smoking status, from 78 countries that represent 85% of people living in extreme poverty globally. Those living in extreme poverty were defined by ordering participants according to a continuous household wealth index or household income value, and then applying World Bank estimates on the proportion of each countrys population that is living in extreme poverty. We used modified Poisson regression models to examine how CVD risk factor prevalence among those in extreme poverty varied by age, sex, educational attainment, and rural versus urban residency. We also calculated the proportion of participants with diabetes or hypertension who self-reported the use of blood pressure- or blood glucose-lowering medication, respectively; the proportion with hypertension who achieved blood pressure control; and the proportion recommended for statin use according to WHO guidelines who reported taking a statin.

ResultsOf 32,695,579 participants, 7,922,289 were living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), 15,986,099 on less than $3.20/day, and 23,466,879 on less than $5.50/day. Among those living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), the age-standardized prevalence was 17.5% (95% CI: 16.7% - 18.3%) for hypertension, 4.0% (95% CI: 3.6% - 4.5%) for diabetes, 10.6% (95% CI: 9.0% - 12.3%) for current smoking, 3.1% (95% CI: 2.8% - 3.3%) for obesity, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9% - 1.9%) for dyslipidemia. In most countries in our analysis, the prevalence of these risk factors among those living in extreme poverty was not notably lower than in the total population. Hypertension treatment and control, diabetes treatment, and statin use were low across all poverty levels in low-income countries, while in lower and upper middle-income countries individuals living at more extreme levels of poverty had a lower probability of reporting the use of these medications and achieving hypertension control.

ConclusionsWe found a high prevalence of CVD risk factors among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty, along with low statin use and low treatment rates for diabetes and hypertension. Our detailed analysis and comparison across poverty levels could inform equity discussions for resource allocation and the design of effective interventions.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280861,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/10/2022,01/10/2022,,"Geldsetzer, P.; Tisdale, R.

Using proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, we identified Numb as a new ciliary protein that positively regulates Hh signaling. Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket and acts as an endocytic adaptor to incorporate Ptch1 into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby promoting Ptch1 exit from the cilium, a key step in Hh signaling activation. Numb loss impaired Sonic Hedgehog-induced Ptch1 departure from the cilium, resulting in severe attenuation of Hh signaling. Genetic ablation of Numb and its homolog Numblike in the developing cerebellum impaired the proliferation of granule cell precursors, a Hh-dependent process, resulting in reduced cerebellar size. This study demonstrates a key function of Numb in controlling protein levels in the cilium, and highlights Numbs critical role in the regulation of Hh signaling.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.10.511655,3.0,new results,01/11/2022,01/11/2022,,"Liu, X.; Yam, P.; Chen, W.-J.; Schlienger, S.; Torres Gutierrez, O.; Cai, E.; Zhang, J.; Ting, A.

We term this strategy, integrating cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) with glycoprotein surface capture, ""structural surfaceomics"". As a proof of principle, we apply this technology to acute myeloid leukemia, a hematologic malignancy with dismal outcomes and no known optimal immunotherapy target. We identify the activated conformation of integrin-{beta}2 as a structurally-defined, widely-expressed, AML-specific target. We develop and characterize recombinant antibodies to this protein conformation, and show that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells eliminate AML cells and patient-derived xenografts without notable toxicity versus normal hematopoietic cells.

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo. In the future, TRAIL can be used to explore how environment, aging, and disease affect tissue homeostasis.",,,biorxiv;2022.04.24.488979,3.0,new results,01/12/2022,01/12/2022,,"Hasper, J.; Welle, K.

Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 15 human organ donors, 20 tissues, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the healthy human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution. In order to construct this atlas, we developed a computational pipeline which identifies high-confidence microbial sequences from three domains of life within the sea of human transcripts in individual cells, and show that this is a non-trivial search for one in a million sequences. Together with data from a separate validation cohort of 8 additional donors, we identify more than a thousand diverse bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. In characterizing the human tissue microbiome, we demonstrate that individuals harbor unique species associated not just with each tissue but often with particular cell types, and that many of these species remain uncharacterized. Moreover, combining our data with the Human Microbiome Project, the tumor microbiome dataset by Nejman et al., and the PATRIC database, we map the likely microbial flow routes from external-facing microbiomes to internal tissues and tumors, and show the existence of many unexpected routes taken by both commensals and pathogens. We find that [~]30% of bacterial species found in tumors are detectable across healthy tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from healthy tissues, even those from distant sites. Increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantify the microbial load and diversity across different cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells.

We used sensitivity analyses and bias analyses to explore such discrepancies in a study of the indirect effects of influenza vaccination.

MethodsWe fit an age-structured, deterministic, compartmental model to estimate indirect effects of a school-based influenza vaccination program in California that was evaluated in a previous matched cohort study. To understand discrepancies in their results, we used 1) a model with constrained parameters such that projections matched the cohort study; and 2) probabilistic bias analyses to identify potential biases (e.g., outcome misclassification due to incomplete influenza testing) that, if corrected, would align the empirical results with the mathematical model.

ResultsThe indirect effect estimate (% reduction in influenza hospitalization among older adults in intervention vs. control) was 22.3% (95% CI 7.6% - 37.1%) in the cohort study but only 1.6% (95% Bayesian credible intervals 0.4 - 4.4%) in the mathematical model. When constrained, mathematical models aligned with the cohort study when there was substantially lower pre-existing immunity among school-age children and older adults. Conversely, empirical estimates corrected for potential bias aligned with mathematical model estimates only if influenza testing rates were 15-23% lower in the intervention vs. comparison site.

ConclusionsSensitivity and bias analysis can shed light on why results of mathematical models and empirical epidemiologic studies differ for the same research question, and in turn, can improve study and model design.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280870,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/13/2022,01/13/2022,,"Arinaminpathy, N.; Reed, C.; Biggerstaff, M.; Nguyen, A.; Athni, T.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",,,biorxiv;2021.07.01.450475,2.0,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,"Wang, C.; Dinesh, R.; Qu, Y.; Rustagi, A.; Cousins, H.; Zengel, J.; Zhang, T.; Magazine, N.; Guo, Y.; Hall, T.; Beck, A.; Heilbroner, L.; Peters-Schulze, G.; Wilk, A.; Tso, L.; Erdemic, E.; Tanudtanud, K.; Ren, S.; Tzeng, K.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction.

Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies.

Here, we present veloVI (velocity variational inference), a deep generative modeling framework for estimating RNA velocity. veloVI learns a gene-specific dynamical model of RNA metabolism and provides a transcriptome-wide quantification of velocity uncertainty. We show in a series of examples that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches for inferring RNA velocity with improvements in fit to the data, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells, and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that properties unique to veloVI, such as posterior velocity uncertainty, can be used to assess the appropriateness of analysis with velocity to the data at hand.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested.

Despite this, we currently lack a predictive understanding of how leaf-associated bacterial communities are structured within and across hosts, including how leaf traits shape this variation and how community assembly processes may differ across distinct microbial habitats on a leaf. In this study, we characterize the composition of bacterial phyllosphere communities from the upper and lower leaf surfaces of 66 plants across 24 species grown at a common site using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing leaves that vary in pH and stomatal densities and analyzing the leaf surfaces separately, we were able to test the key factors shaping the phyllosphere across host plant species from diverse geographical origins. We found a surprisingly large shared/core microbiome across species, as well as a strong effect of plant species and native origin in shaping composition. Importantly, we found the lower leaf side, where pH values are generally lower and stomatal densities higher, to have lower taxonomic richness relative to the upper leaf side. While the upper leaf side community appears to be more strongly influenced by dispersal effects, the lower leaf appears to be more strongly influenced by plant host filtering effects, as supported by higher relative abundance of shared core taxa and higher signatures of endemism.

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.

MethodsWe collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.

ResultsAmong 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples. Among 1,321 RT-PCR positive samples, 938/1321 (71%) were detected by BinaxNOW; 95% (774/817) of those with Ct value <30 were detected by BinaxNOW. BinaxNOW detection was consistent over lineages. In analyses to evaluate entry to treatment, BinaxNOW detected 82.7% (410/496, 95% CI: 79-86%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In comparison, RT-PCR (24-hour turnaround) detected 83.1% (412/496 95% CI: 79-86%) and RT-PCR (48-hour turnaround) detected 66.3% (329/496 95% CI: 62-70%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW detected high viral load from anterior nasal swabs consistently across omicron sublineages emerging between January and June of 2022.

While many studies have focused on tick-borne bacteria, far less is known about tick-associated viruses and their roles in public health or tick physiology. To address this, we investigated patterns of bacterial and viral communities across two field populations of western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 100 individual ticks, we quantified taxon prevalence, abundance, and co-occurrence with other members of the tick microbiome. Our analysis revealed 11 novel RNA viruses from Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Picornaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Reoviridae, Solemovidiae, Narnaviridae, and 2 highly divergent RNA viruses lacking sequence similarity to known viral families. The majority of these viruses were also detectable in lab-raised ticks at all developmental life stages, localize to tick salivary glands, and show evidence of circulation in mice fed on by ticks. These data suggest that viruses are stable, heritable, and transmissible members of the tick microbiota. We also unexpectedly identified numerous virus-like transcripts that are associated with tick genomic DNA, most of which are distinct from known endogenous viral element-mediated immunity pathways in invertebrates. Together, our work reveals that in addition to potentially serving as vectors for potential viral pathogens, I. pacificus ticks may also have symbiotic partnerships with their own vertically-transmitted viruses or with ancient viruses through evolutionarily acquired virus-like transcripts.

We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties.

In this work, we develop RNA-ODE, a principled computational framework that extends RNA velocity to quantify systems level dynamics and improve single-cell data analysis. We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism. Given a snapshot of gene expression at one time, RNA-ODE is able to predict and extrapolate the expression trajectory of each cell by solving the dynamic equations. Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. It also infers gene regulatory networks and identifies influential genes whose expression changes can decide cell fate. We expect RNA-ODE to be a Swiss army knife that aids many facets of single-cell RNA-seq analysis.",RNA velocity ; dynamical systems model of biology ; expression dynamics ; machine learning ; single-cell RNA sequencing,,,,,2022/5/1/6/0,2022/04/27,2022/5/1/6/0,Ruishan Liu ; Angela Oliveira Pisco ; Emelie Braun ; Sten Linnarsson ; James Zou,,"Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

After optimization, top-performing barcodes had ∼10-fold increased capacity relative to the best random-screened designs and performed reliably across diverse cell types. DAISY barcode arrays generated ∼12 bits of entropy and ∼66,000 unique barcodes. Thus, DAISY barcodes-at a fraction of the size of Cas9 barcodes-achieved high-capacity barcoding. We coupled DAISY barcoding with single-cell RNA-seq to recover lineages and gene expression profiles from ∼47,000 human melanoma cells.

This task is particularly challenging for numerous biomedically important targets in human cells, including membrane proteins and large macromolecular assemblies, hampering mechanistic studies and drug development efforts. Here we describe a method combining CRISPR-Cas gene editing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to rapidly tag and purify endogenous proteins in HEK cells for structural characterization. We applied this approach to study the human proteasome from HEK cells and rapidly determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of major proteasomal complexes, including a high-resolution structure of intact human PA28αβ-20S. Our structures reveal that PA28 with a subunit stoichiometry of 3α/4β engages tightly with the 20S proteasome. Addition of a hydrophilic peptide shows that polypeptides entering through PA28 are held in the antechamber of 20S prior to degradation in the proteolytic chamber.

How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",,,,,,2022/8/16/6/0,2022/08/15,2022/8/16/6/0,Takayoshi Shirasaki ;

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",DNA damage ; SA-beta-Gal ; cell cycle ; cell size ; p16(INK4) ; palbociclib ; polyploidy ; proteomics ; senescence ; size-scaling,,,,,2022/8/21/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/8/21/6/0,Michael C Lanz ; Evgeny Zatulovskiy ; Matthew P Swaffer ; Lichao Zhang ; Ilayda Ilerten ; Shuyuan Zhang ; Dong Shin You ; Georgi Marinov ; Patrick McAlpine ; Joshua E Elias ; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Here we develop a smart bone plate to wirelessly monitor healing utilizing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to provide real-time data on tissue composition within the fracture callus. To validate our technology, we created a 1-mm rabbit tibial defect and fixed the bone with a standard veterinary plate modified with a custom-designed housing that included two impedance sensors capable of wireless transmission. Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products.

Given that brief intervention can effectively reduce hazardous alcohol consumption, this study aimed to investigate how hypertensive patients with concomitant alcohol use are identified and treated in Thai primary care settings and what this may mean for screening and lifestyle intervention strategies. In a cross-sectional, mixed-method design, we surveyed 91 participants from three different groups of Thai stakeholders: policy- and decisionmakers; healthcare practitioners; and patients diagnosed with hypertension. Data was collected between December 2020 and May 2021. Responses were analyzed descriptively and using open coding tools to identify current practices, barriers, facilitators, and implications for interventions. All stakeholder groups regarded alcohol use as an important driver of hypertension. While lifestyle interventions among hypertensive patients were perceived as beneficial, current lifestyle support was limited. Barriers included limited resources in primary healthcare facilities, lack of continuous monitoring or follow-up, missing tools or procedures for risk assessment and lifestyle intervention, and stigmatization of alcohol use. Our results suggest that although screening for lifestyle risk factors (including alcohol use) and lifestyle interventions are not yet sufficiently established, a wide range of stakeholders still recognize the potential of interventions targeted at hazardous alcohol use among hypertensive patients.

Most broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) previously described target the native prefusion conformation of HIV-1 Envelope (Env), but the relevance of the tiered categories for inhibitors targeting another Env conformation, the pre-hairpin intermediate, is not well understood. Here we show that two inhibitors targeting distinct highly-conserved regions of the pre-hairpin intermediate have strikingly consistent neutralization potencies (within [~]100-fold for a given inhibitor) against strains in all three neutralization tiers of HIV-1; in contrast, best-in-class bnAbs targeting diverse Env epitopes vary by more than 10,000-fold in potency against these strains.

Evidence on CVD risk factor prevalence among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty globally is sparse because studies have used measures of socioeconomic status that are not comparable across study populations and countries. For adults living in extreme poverty, this study aimed to determine i) the prevalence of each of five key CVD risk factors, ii) how the prevalence of these CVD risk factors varies across and within countries, and iii) the level of treatment coverage with statin, antihypertensive, and diabetes therapy.

MethodsWe pooled individual-level data from 105 nationally representative household surveys with physical measurements of hypertension, diabetes, overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as self-reported smoking status, from 78 countries that represent 85% of people living in extreme poverty globally. Those living in extreme poverty were defined by ordering participants according to a continuous household wealth index or household income value, and then applying World Bank estimates on the proportion of each countrys population that is living in extreme poverty. We used modified Poisson regression models to examine how CVD risk factor prevalence among those in extreme poverty varied by age, sex, educational attainment, and rural versus urban residency. We also calculated the proportion of participants with diabetes or hypertension who self-reported the use of blood pressure- or blood glucose-lowering medication, respectively; the proportion with hypertension who achieved blood pressure control; and the proportion recommended for statin use according to WHO guidelines who reported taking a statin.

ResultsOf 32,695,579 participants, 7,922,289 were living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), 15,986,099 on less than $3.20/day, and 23,466,879 on less than $5.50/day. Among those living in extreme poverty (<$1.90 per day), the age-standardized prevalence was 17.5% (95% CI: 16.7% - 18.3%) for hypertension, 4.0% (95% CI: 3.6% - 4.5%) for diabetes, 10.6% (95% CI: 9.0% - 12.3%) for current smoking, 3.1% (95% CI: 2.8% - 3.3%) for obesity, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9% - 1.9%) for dyslipidemia. In most countries in our analysis, the prevalence of these risk factors among those living in extreme poverty was not notably lower than in the total population. Hypertension treatment and control, diabetes treatment, and statin use were low across all poverty levels in low-income countries, while in lower and upper middle-income countries individuals living at more extreme levels of poverty had a lower probability of reporting the use of these medications and achieving hypertension control.

ConclusionsWe found a high prevalence of CVD risk factors among adults living below the World Banks international line for extreme poverty, along with low statin use and low treatment rates for diabetes and hypertension. Our detailed analysis and comparison across poverty levels could inform equity discussions for resource allocation and the design of effective interventions.",,,medrxiv;2022.10.08.22280861,1.0,PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT,01/10/2022,01/10/2022,,"Geldsetzer, P.; Tisdale, R.

Using proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, we identified Numb as a new ciliary protein that positively regulates Hh signaling. Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket and acts as an endocytic adaptor to incorporate Ptch1 into clathrin-coated vesicles, thereby promoting Ptch1 exit from the cilium, a key step in Hh signaling activation. Numb loss impaired Sonic Hedgehog-induced Ptch1 departure from the cilium, resulting in severe attenuation of Hh signaling. Genetic ablation of Numb and its homolog Numblike in the developing cerebellum impaired the proliferation of granule cell precursors, a Hh-dependent process, resulting in reduced cerebellar size. This study demonstrates a key function of Numb in controlling protein levels in the cilium, and highlights Numbs critical role in the regulation of Hh signaling.",,,biorxiv;2022.10.10.511655,3.0,new results,01/11/2022,01/11/2022,,"Liu, X.; Yam, P.; Chen, W.-J.; Schlienger, S.; Torres Gutierrez, O.; Cai, E.; Zhang, J.; Ting, A.

We term this strategy, integrating cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) with glycoprotein surface capture, ""structural surfaceomics"". As a proof of principle, we apply this technology to acute myeloid leukemia, a hematologic malignancy with dismal outcomes and no known optimal immunotherapy target.

Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo.

Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 15 human organ donors, 20 tissues, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the healthy human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution. In order to construct this atlas, we developed a computational pipeline which identifies high-confidence microbial sequences from three domains of life within the sea of human transcripts in individual cells, and show that this is a non-trivial search for one in a million sequences. Together with data from a separate validation cohort of 8 additional donors, we identify more than a thousand diverse bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. In characterizing the human tissue microbiome, we demonstrate that individuals harbor unique species associated not just with each tissue but often with particular cell types, and that many of these species remain uncharacterized. Moreover, combining our data with the Human Microbiome Project, the tumor microbiome dataset by Nejman et al., and the PATRIC database, we map the likely microbial flow routes from external-facing microbiomes to internal tissues and tumors, and show the existence of many unexpected routes taken by both commensals and pathogens. We find that [~]30% of bacterial species found in tumors are detectable across healthy tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from healthy tissues, even those from distant sites. Increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantify the microbial load and diversity across different cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells.

We used sensitivity analyses and bias analyses to explore such discrepancies in a study of the indirect effects of influenza vaccination.

MethodsWe fit an age-structured, deterministic, compartmental model to estimate indirect effects of a school-based influenza vaccination program in California that was evaluated in a previous matched cohort study. To understand discrepancies in their results, we used 1) a model with constrained parameters such that projections matched the cohort study; and 2) probabilistic bias analyses to identify potential biases (e.g., outcome misclassification due to incomplete influenza testing) that, if corrected, would align the empirical results with the mathematical model.

ResultsThe indirect effect estimate (% reduction in influenza hospitalization among older adults in intervention vs. control) was 22.3% (95% CI 7.6% - 37.1%) in the cohort study but only 1.6% (95% Bayesian credible intervals 0.4 - 4.4%) in the mathematical model. When constrained, mathematical models aligned with the cohort study when there was substantially lower pre-existing immunity among school-age children and older adults. Conversely, empirical estimates corrected for potential bias aligned with mathematical model estimates only if influenza testing rates were 15-23% lower in the intervention vs. comparison site.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs and the brain are also susceptible to infection. While many patients suffer from diverse neurological symptoms, the viruss neuronal entry remains mysterious. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. This unbiased gain-of-function screening identified both novel and previously validated host factors. Notably, newly found host factors have high expression in neuronal and immune cells, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We validated these factors using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. Notably, the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Analysis of human olfactory epithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+/TUJ1+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies-- have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2. The presence of KCNA6 may thus explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top identified host factors, and performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ~8 million patients. This large cohort study revealed a statistically significant association between top drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. Taken together, the potassium channel KCNA6 facilitates neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising target for drug repurposing and development.",,,biorxiv;2021.07.01.450475,2.0,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,"Wang, C.; Dinesh, R.; Qu, Y.; Rustagi, A.; Cousins, H.; Zengel, J.; Zhang, T.; Magazine, N.; Guo, Y.; Hall, T.; Beck, A.; Heilbroner, L.; Peters-Schulze, G.; Wilk, A.; Tso, L.; Erdemic, E.; Tanudtanud, K.; Ren, S.; Tzeng, K.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.

Neural networkscan assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manualannotations, while unsupervised approaches have fared poorly in ultrasound todate. Objectives: We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labelsrequired) segmentation of cardiac chambers, combining computer vision, clinicaldomain knowledge, and deep learning. Methods: We trained on 450 echocardiograms(145,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; meanage 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculatestructural and functional measurements. We also tested our pipeline againstexternal images from an additional 10,030 patients (20,060 images) withavailable manual tracings of the left ventricle. Results: r2 between clinicallymeasured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reportedinter-clinician variation for LVESV and LVEDV (pipeline vs. clinical r2= 0.74and r2=0.65, respectively), LVEF and LV mass (r2= 0.46 and r2=0.54), left andright atrium volumes (r2=0.7 and r2=0.6), and right ventricle area (r2=0.47).When binarized into normal vs. abnormal categories, average accuracy was 0.81(range 0.71-0.95). A subset of the test echocardiograms (n=553) hadcorresponding cardiac MRI; correlation between pipeline and CMR measurementswas similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and CMR. Finally, in theexternal dataset, our pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with anaverage Dice score of 0.83 (95% CI 0.83).

However, the effects of COVID-19 on the lung endothelium are not well defined. We hypothesized that the lung endotheliopathy of COVID-19 is caused by circulating host factors and direct endothelial infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 or sera from patients with COVID-19 on the permeability and inflammatory activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2; inactivated viral particles; or sera from patients with COVID-19, patients without COVID-19, and healthy volunteers. Permeability was determined by measuring transendothelial resistance to electrical current flow, where decreased resistance signifies increased permeability. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in culture supernatants. Endothelial biomarkers were quantified in patient sera. Measurements and Main Results: Viral PCR confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 enters and replicates in endothelial cells. Live SARS-CoV-2, but not dead virus or spike protein, induces endothelial permeability and secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. There was substantial variability in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells from different donors. Sera from patients with COVID-19 induced endothelial permeability, which correlated with disease severity. Serum levels of endothelial activation and injury biomarkers were increased in patients with COVID-19 and correlated with severity of illness. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infects and dysregulates endothelial cell functions. Circulating factors in patients with COVID-19 also induce endothelial cell dysfunction.

Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies. The network nature of hormone regulation and the principles discovered here further emphasize the importance of a systems approach to understanding hormone regulation.",,,biorxiv;2021.12.13.472243,2.0,new results,01/14/2022,01/14/2022,,"Liu, S.; Ezran, C.; Wang, M.

Here, we present veloVI (velocity variational inference), a deep generative modeling framework for estimating RNA velocity. veloVI learns a gene-specific dynamical model of RNA metabolism and provides a transcriptome-wide quantification of velocity uncertainty. We show in a series of examples that veloVI compares favorably to previous approaches for inferring RNA velocity with improvements in fit to the data, consistency across transcriptionally similar cells, and stability across preprocessing pipelines for quantifying RNA abundance. Further, we demonstrate that properties unique to veloVI, such as posterior velocity uncertainty, can be used to assess the appropriateness of analysis with velocity to the data at hand.

Encapsulating cells within picoliter double emulsion (DE) (water-in-oil-in-water) droplets allows sorting on commercially available FACS machines, making it possible to isolate single cells based on phenotypes of interest for downstream sequencing and PCR analyses. However, DE droplets must be within the range of large cells (<20 pl) for sorting on standard cytometers, posing challenges for molecular biology as prior reports suggest that reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification cannot proceed efficiently at volumes below 1 nL due to cell lysate-induced inhibition. To overcome this limitation, we used a plate-based RT-PCR assay designed to mimic reactions in picoliter droplets to systematically quantify and ameliorate the inhibition. We find that RT-PCR is blocked by lysate-induced cleavage of nucleic acid probes and primers, but that this cleavage can be efficiently alleviated through heat lysis that simultaneously inactivates inhibitory lysate components. We further show that the magnitude of RT-PCR inhibition depends strongly on cell type, but that RT-PCR can proceed in low-picoscale reaction volumes for most cell lines tested. Finally, we demonstrate one-step RT-PCR from single cells in 20 pL double emulsion droplets with fluorescence detectable via FACS.

Despite this, we currently lack a predictive understanding of how leaf-associated bacterial communities are structured within and across hosts, including how leaf traits shape this variation and how community assembly processes may differ across distinct microbial habitats on a leaf. In this study, we characterize the composition of bacterial phyllosphere communities from the upper and lower leaf surfaces of 66 plants across 24 species grown at a common site using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing leaves that vary in pH and stomatal densities and analyzing the leaf surfaces separately, we were able to test the key factors shaping the phyllosphere across host plant species from diverse geographical origins. We found a surprisingly large shared/core microbiome across species, as well as a strong effect of plant species and native origin in shaping composition. Importantly, we found the lower leaf side, where pH values are generally lower and stomatal densities higher, to have lower taxonomic richness relative to the upper leaf side. While the upper leaf side community appears to be more strongly influenced by dispersal effects, the lower leaf appears to be more strongly influenced by plant host filtering effects, as supported by higher relative abundance of shared core taxa and higher signatures of endemism.

Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR, rapid results could facilitate entry to treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 variants and host immunity evolve, it is important to characterize the use case for rapid antigen tests for treatment entry.

MethodsWe collected anterior nasal swabs for BinaxNOW and RT-PCR testing and clinical data at a walk-up, community site in San Francisco, California between January and June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples and classified according to subtype and variant. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimate the expected proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who would have been diagnosed within 5 days of symptom onset using RT-PCR versus BinaxNOW testing.

ResultsAmong 25,309 persons tested with BinaxNOW, 2,952 had concomitant RT-PCR. 1321/2952 (44.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. We identified waves of predominant omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, BA.4, and BA.5 among 720 sequenced samples. Among 1,321 RT-PCR positive samples, 938/1321 (71%) were detected by BinaxNOW; 95% (774/817) of those with Ct value <30 were detected by BinaxNOW. BinaxNOW detection was consistent over lineages. In analyses to evaluate entry to treatment, BinaxNOW detected 82.7% (410/496, 95% CI: 79-86%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset. In comparison, RT-PCR (24-hour turnaround) detected 83.1% (412/496 95% CI: 79-86%) and RT-PCR (48-hour turnaround) detected 66.3% (329/496 95% CI: 62-70%) of persons with COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW detected high viral load from anterior nasal swabs consistently across omicron sublineages emerging between January and June of 2022.

While many studies have focused on tick-borne bacteria, far less is known about tick-associated viruses and their roles in public health or tick physiology. To address this, we investigated patterns of bacterial and viral communities across two field populations of western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 100 individual ticks, we quantified taxon prevalence, abundance, and co-occurrence with other members of the tick microbiome. Our analysis revealed 11 novel RNA viruses from Rhabdoviridae, Chuviridae, Picornaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Reoviridae, Solemovidiae, Narnaviridae, and 2 highly divergent RNA viruses lacking sequence similarity to known viral families. The majority of these viruses were also detectable in lab-raised ticks at all developmental life stages, localize to tick salivary glands, and show evidence of circulation in mice fed on by ticks. These data suggest that viruses are stable, heritable, and transmissible members of the tick microbiota. We also unexpectedly identified numerous virus-like transcripts that are associated with tick genomic DNA, most of which are distinct from known endogenous viral element-mediated immunity pathways in invertebrates. Together, our work reveals that in addition to potentially serving as vectors for potential viral pathogens, I. pacificus ticks may also have symbiotic partnerships with their own vertically-transmitted viruses or with ancient viruses through evolutionarily acquired virus-like transcripts.

In recent years, manyadvancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines,and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especiallycomplex polygonal geometries. In this work, we focus on developing ageneral-purpose polygon encoding model, which can encode a polygonal geometry(with or without holes, single or multipolygons) into an embedding space. Theresult embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream taskssuch as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. Toachieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirableproperties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutationinvariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for theencoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the otherleverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, wepropose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular paddingto achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domainapproach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation(NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties.

The climate change AI (CCAI) community works on a diverse,challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML orheterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automatedmachine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performingarchitectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, webenchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find thatout-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass theperformance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few keyweaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailoredto computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of searchspaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designedfor spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to thediscovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gainsacross numerous CCAI applications.

We model the gene expression dynamics by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based formalism.

Systematic experiments on simulations and on new data from developing brain demonstrate that RNA-ODE substantially improves many aspects of standard single-cell analysis. By leveraging temporal dynamics, RNA-ODE more accurately estimates cell state lineage and pseudo-time compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe interactions of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid with components of host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) that play an essential role in release. We show release of quasi-enveloped virus (eHAV) in exosome-like vesicles requires a conserved export signal located within the 8 kDa C-terminal VP1 pX extension that functions in a manner analogous to late domains of canonical enveloped viruses. Fusing pX to a self-assembling engineered protein nanocage (EPN-pX) resulted in its ESCRT-dependent release in extracellular vesicles. Mutational analysis identified a 24 amino acid peptide sequence located within the center of pX that was both necessary and sufficient for nanocage release. Deleting a YxxL motif within this sequence ablated eHAV release, resulting in virus accumulating intracellularly. The pX export signal is conserved in non-human hepatoviruses from a wide range of mammalian species, and functional in pX sequences from bat hepatoviruses when fused to the nanocage protein, suggesting these viruses are released as quasi-enveloped virions. Quantitative proteomics identified multiple ESCRT-related proteins associating with EPN-pX, including ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and its paralog, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a second Bro1 domain protein linked to sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into multivesicular endosomes. RNAi-mediated depletion of either Bro1 domain protein impeded eHAV release. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of viral capsids with endogenous ALIX and HD-PTP. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using biotin-tagged peptides and recombinant proteins revealed pX interacts directly through the export signal with N-terminal Bro1 domains of both HD-PTP and ALIX. Our study identifies an exceptionally potent viral export signal mediating extracellular release of virus-sized protein assemblies and shows release requires non-redundant activities of both HD-PTP and ALIX.",,,,,,2022/8/16/6/0,2022/08/15,2022/8/16/6/0,Takayoshi Shirasaki ;

A PSL2-targeting locked nucleic acid (LNA), administered 3 d after, or 14 d before, a lethal IAV inoculum provided 100% survival in mice, led to the development of strong immunity to rechallenge with a tenfold lethal inoculum, evaded attempts to select for resistance and retained full potency against neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant virus.

To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",DNA damage ; SA-beta-Gal ; cell cycle ; cell size ; p16(INK4) ; palbociclib ; polyploidy ; proteomics ; senescence ; size-scaling,,,,,2022/8/21/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/8/21/6/0,Michael C Lanz ; Evgeny Zatulovskiy ; Matthew P Swaffer ; Lichao Zhang ; Ilayda Ilerten ; Shuyuan Zhang ; Dong Shin You ; Georgi Marinov ; Patrick McAlpine ; Joshua E Elias ; Jan M Skotheim,,"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.;Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Impedance magnitude and phase measurements were transmitted every 48 h for up to 10 weeks. Bone healing was assessed by X-ray, µCT, and histology. Our results indicated the sensors successfully incorporated into the fracture callus and did not impede repair. Electrical impedance, resistance, and reactance increased steadily from weeks 3 to 7-corresponding to the transition from hematoma to cartilage to bone within the fracture gap-then plateaued as the bone began to consolidate. These three electrical readings significantly correlated with traditional measurements of bone healing and successfully distinguished between union and not-healed fractures, with the strongest relationship found with impedance magnitude.

THP is a precursor in the production of the drugs atracurium and cisatracurium, and papaverine is used as an antispasmodic during vascular surgery. In recent years, metabolic engineering advances have enabled the production of natural products through heterologous expression of pathway enzymes in yeast. Heterologous biosynthesis of THP and papaverine could play a role in ensuring a stable supply of these clinically significant products. Biosynthesis of THP and papaverine has not been achieved to date, in part because multiple pathway enzymes have not been elucidated. Here, we describe the development of an engineered yeast strain for de novo biosynthesis of THP. The production of THP is achieved through heterologous expression of two enzyme variants with activity on nonnative substrates. Through protein engineering, we developed a variant of ",metabolic engineering ; papaverine ; plant natural products ; protein engineering ; tetrahydropapaverine,,,,,2022/8/9/6/0,2022/08/08,2022/8/9/6/0,Osman K Jamil ; Aaron Cravens ; James T Payne ; Colin Y Kim ; Christina D Smolke,,"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.;Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.;Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.","Osman K Jamil: Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Aaron Cravens: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.James T Payne: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Colin Y Kim: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.Christina D Smolke: Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA 94158.",,,,,,0,"Blish, Catherine"

Given that brief intervention can effectively reduce hazardous alcohol consumption, this study aimed to investigate how hypertensive patients with concomitant alcohol use are identified and treated in Thai primary care settings and what this may mean for screening and lifestyle intervention strategies. In a cross-sectional, mixed-method design, we surveyed 91 participants from three different groups of Thai stakeholders: policy- and decisionmakers; healthcare practitioners; and patients diagnosed with hypertension. Data was collected between December 2020 and May 2021. Responses were analyzed descriptively and using open coding tools to identify current practices, barriers, facilitators, and implications for interventions. All stakeholder groups regarded alcohol use as an important driver of hypertension. While lifestyle interventions among hypertensive patients were perceived as beneficial, current lifestyle support was limited. Barriers included limited resources in primary healthcare facilities, lack of continuous monitoring or follow-up, missing tools or procedures for risk assessment and lifestyle intervention, and stigmatization of alcohol use. Our results suggest that although screening for lifestyle risk factors (including alcohol use) and lifestyle interventions are not yet sufficiently established, a wide range of stakeholders still recognize the potential of interventions targeted at hazardous alcohol use among hypertensive patients. Future interventions may establish standardized assessment tools, be tailored to high-risk groups, and include electronic or remote elements.",Alcohol use ; Hypertension ; Lifestyle intervention ; Primary Health Care ; Screening and brief intervention ; Stakeholder survey ; Thailand,,,,,2022/9/27/6/0,2022/08/19,2022/9/27/6/0,Julia M Lemp ; Supa Pengpid ; Doungjai Buntup ; Till W Bärnighausen ; Pascal Geldsetzer ; Karl Peltzer ; Jürgen Rehm ; Bundit Sornpaisarn ; Charlotte Probst,,"ASEAN Institute for Health Development, Mahidol University, Salaya, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.;ASEAN Institute for Health Development, Mahidol University, Salaya, Phutthamonthon, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.; Department of Research Administration and Development, University of Limpopo, Turfloop, South Africa.;Department of Research Administration and Development, University of Limpopo, Turfloop, South Africa.; Department of Psychology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.;Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.; Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI), KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.;Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.; Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University, Ratchathewi, Bangkok, Thailand.;Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.; Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, ON, Canada.; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; I.M.
